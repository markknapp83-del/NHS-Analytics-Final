The Mersey Regional Burns and Plastic Surgery Unit at Whiston Hospital and the Northwest Regional Spinal Injuries Centre at Southport Hospital serves a population of over 4 million across the whole of Cheshire and Merseyside, The Isle of Man and North Wales.  Objectives for Sustainable Procurement  Sustainability in purchasing need not necessarily cost more and there is now a much wider choice of environmentally friendly products. \"Green goods\" are not necessarily more expensive; often if the 'whole life cost' of a product is considered the cheapest product is more expensive in the long run. Whole life costing means taking into account the total cost of an item over its lifetime such as raw materials sourcing, running costs, transportation, admin costs and disposal costs.  The overarching objective is for sustainability considerations to be addressed within the procurement cycle in all instances.   The more specific objectives in terms of sustainable procurement are:  To seek alternatives to products and processes which are detrimental to the environment and social wellâbeing by using more environmentally friendly and ethically traded products and processes. To minimise waste, including: any packaging, waste produced by the product (or service) in question, and waste generated by the eventual disposal of the product.  MWL are looking for a partner to carry out planned preventative maintenance and inspections to the fire dampers at Southport District General Hospital and Ormskirk District General Hospital. Inspections will be required to develop a detailed list of remedial work that has been identified and it will be the suppliers responsibility to carry out all of the remedials as per the specification.",

    "description": "NHS Northamptonshire Integrated Care Board are seeking providers from the voluntary and community sector (VCS) to deliver a Northamptonshire HIV Peer Support service by those that are HIV positive.\r\n\r\nIn 2023, the Lancet noted that Opt-out testing in the UK is particularly effective at identifying those disproportionately affected by a late diagnosis, including women, older people, and those from Black African communities. These groups are less likely to access sexual health services and would require a wider reach than the local charities who have proactively incorporated HIV support into youth counselling and advice to gay or bisexual men. Quality peer support for diagnosed patients, will be delivered by those who are HIV positive and support the following:\r\n\r\nâ¢ Work as part of a multi-disciplinary team (MDT), bringing their own knowledge and experience.\r\nâ¢ Help develop self-management strategies, deal with stigma, reduce isolation and improve wellbeing.\r\nâ¢ Link and retain people into HIV care, improving antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, and consequently ensuring ongoing viral suppression and avoidance of virologic failure.\r\nâ¢ Refer/signpost into specialist services such as mental health and substance misuse where appropriate.\r\nâ¢ Should be available to those who are newly diagnosed or who find it difficult to adjust to their diagnosis.\r\nâ¢ Support the eight standards listed in the https://www.bhiva.org/standards-of-care-2018\r\nâ¢ Follow the https://positivelyuk.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/national_standards_final_web.pdf guidance and its four standards.\r\n\r\nFurther details on the service are available in the attached Breakdown of Expected Tasks. This includes the expectation to develop a sustainability plan to ensure service delivery beyond this period of ICB funding.\r\n\r\nInterested providers are asked to complete the attached expression of interest form (EoI) and return via the Atamis e-tendering portal (https://health-family.force.com/s/Welcome) by 12pm noon on Friday 17th January 2025.\r\n\r\nProviders who meet the requirements of the EoI may be taken forward to a grant agreement at the Commissioners discretion. The total funding available for this grant is Â£68,310. This funding may be provided to multiple organisations and values are subject to change. Providers must be willing to work in partnership with other organisations if required as part of any service delivery.\r\n\r\nThis service is separate to the opt-out testing programme being delivered by local emergency departments however the provider will be expected to work alongside this and local sexual health and other services, to ensure a coordinated pathway for patients.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nTo express interest and participate in the tender, please register and apply via Atamis e-sourcing portal https://health-family.force.com/s/Welcome.\r\n\r\nShould Tenderers have any queries, or having problems using the portal, they should contact Helpdesk at:\r\n\r\nPhone: 0800 9956035\r\n\r\nE-mail: support-health@atamis.co.uk",

Evidence has shown socio-economic factors, influencing health and well-being by 40%, outweighing other contributors like health behaviours (30%), clinical care (20%), and the built environment (10%).\r\n\r\nMoreover, integrating social prescribing with existing services in Norfolk and Waveney, aims to provide a centralised access point for digital devices, data, and support. This approach enhances reporting mechanisms, identifies gaps, and ensures inclusivity, particularly for those with protected characteristics or belonging to inclusion health groups, especially for patients at risk of digital exclusion.\r\n\r\nThis service aligns with the Shared Care Record, establishing a Social Prescribing Digital Platform to facilitate seamless referrals to non-clinical provisions. The platform serves as a case management system for non-clinical activities and offers an overview of input and output. The goal is to streamline access to care, support proactive personalised care through integrated teams, and contribute to health equity.\r\n\r\nFurther backed by two key recommendations for the health and care system: \r\n\r\nThe publication of the Fuller Report: Next Steps for Integrating Primary Care (2022) gives a clear mandate for the contribution of non-clinical services in achieving the objectives of: \r\nâ¢\tStreamlining access to care and advice \r\nâ¢\tProviding more proactive, personalised care supported through a neighbourhood Integrated Team\r\nâ¢\tHelping people to stay well for longer.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the Hewitt review provides recommendations to support health equity and improvement though: \r\nâ¢\tEmpowering patients through the NHS app and new Citizen Health Accounts\r\nâ¢\tEmbed health promotion at all levels to improve population health and ensure the longer-term sustainability of the health and care system.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nInitial term of 2 years with option to extend for up a further 2 years.",

    "description": "The GP Hubs service forms part of the Integrated Urgent Care Service in Croydon. We currently provide 3 GP Hubs across the borough that are open 8am to 8pm 7 days per week. The hubs will see patients with an urgent primary care condition via a booked appointment. Patients can access the service via NHS 111, webform booking or in some cases walk in (where they will be given an appointment slot). Patients are required to be seen within 90 minutes of their booked appointment time. \r\n\r\nThe hubs are based in Purley War Memorial Hospital (south of the borough), Parkway Health Centre (New Addington, East of the borough) and a hub on site at Croydon Health Service NHS Trust (North of the borough) which allows for Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) colleagues to re-direct patients to a more appropriate setting. The service sees patients from any borough/ICB footprint and currently see around 4,800 patients per month. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the GP hubs is to provide a more appropriate setting for patients with an urgent, low-level acuity need. Conditions range from acute ear infection to minor injuries treated with gluing/suturing to minor trauma to hands, feet, or limb. This is in contrast to the other services within Integrated Urgent Care such as the UTC which will treat patients for more serious minor injuries for which treatment and investigations include; X-Ray, pathology, fracture clinic, CT, dressing of major wounds etc.\r\n\r\nThe tender will also require bidders to submit two financial bids for running both 3 and 4 hubs in order to inform decision making on affordability and value for money.\r\n\r\nPlease take into account the annual budget for this new contract is circa Â£2.6m.\r\n\r\nContract will be for an initial 3 year period with the option to extend for a further two years.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nTo express interest and participate in the tender, please register and apply via Atamis e-sourcing portal https://health-family.force.com/s/Welcome.\r\n\r\nShould Tenderers have any queries, or having problems using the portal, they should contact Helpdesk at:\r\n\r\nPhone: 0800 9956035\r\n\r\nE-mail: support-health@atamis.co.uk",

    "description": "Background to the Programme\r\n\r\nThe population of children and young people in Greenwich is diverse, with approximately 65,800 (22%) of the population under the age of 18. The area faces significant deprivation, with many experiencing social, economic, and environmental disadvantages.\r\nRecent data shows a growing concern regarding the mental health of children and young people in Greenwich, with increasing cases of anxiety, depression, and self-harm. Mental health conditions are the second largest contributor to poor health among residents, profoundly impacting quality of life.\r\n\r\nEvidence has highlighted the potential of a SPA to improve young people's access to mental health services. By addressing barriers to access, simplifying where to go to get help and making it easier to contact the service directly, a SPA can help more individuals and families access timely support. \r\n \r\nThe Royal Borough of Greenwich (RBG) and South East London Integrated Care Board (ICB), in partnership with NHS Oxleas Foundation Trust, are seeking a provider to support the development and implementation of a Single Point of Access (SPA) for all emotional wellbeing and mental health needs of children, young people (CYP), and their families.\r\nThe SPA's development will align with the strategic priorities of the NHS Long Term Plan, the RBG Health and Wellbeing Strategy, and local commissioning priorities (ICB and RBG).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat We Are Looking For\r\n\r\nThe primary goal is to create a seamless referral service for all mental health and emotional wellbeing needs of children and young people. This will enable system partners to better identify and deliver the most appropriate support for CYP, who present with various levels of mental health and emotional wellbeing needs.\r\nThe selected provider will:\r\nâ¢\tLead the development, engagement, and co-production of the SPA, collaborating with families, children, young people, voluntary and statutory sector partners, and relevant private organisations.\r\nâ¢\tDevelop robust clinical governance and pathways to establish the SPA.\r\nâ¢\tFacilitate a task and finish group involving partners from various organisations and services to inform SPA development.\r\nâ¢\tCreate a seamless referral pathway into the SPA.\r\nâ¢\tPropose the infrastructure required to support the SPA, both internal and external.\r\nâ¢\tDesign the team that will operate the SPA, detailing skill sets and specialisms needed.\r\nâ¢\tPropose the technology necessary to develop a seamless SPA and digital front door.\r\nâ¢\tDefine success criteria and outcomes to be achieved through the SPA.\r\nâ¢\tImplement and mobilise the agreed SPA.\r\nâ¢\tProvide clear timelines with key milestones for SPA development.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the Royal Borough reserves the right to extend the contract by a further year making it a possible total of 3 years.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nPrice is not the only award criterion and all criteria are stated in the procurement documents.

However, the Service Provider will remain responsible for the delivery of all elements of the Services and will deliver the different elements within a single service structure using uniform processes and systems for management and monitoring of the Services.\r\n\r\nThe Service Provider will directly provide or work in partnership or sub-contract to deliver: \r\n\r\ni.\tIndependent Mental Capacity Advocacy (IMCA) service across East Sussex, Brighton & Hove and West Sussex\r\nii.\tRelevant Person's Paid Representative (RPPR) service across East Sussex, Brighton & Hove and West Sussex; \r\niii.\tIndependent Care Act Advocacy (ICAA) for Brighton & Hove and West Sussex;\r\niv.\tIndependent Mental Health Advocacy (IMHA) for Brighton & Hove and West Sussex;\r\nv.\tIndependent Health Complaints Advocacy (IHCA) for Brighton & Hove; \r\nvi.\tCommunity Mental Health Advocacy for Brighton & Hove and West Sussex;\r\nvii.\tand Specialist Community Advocacy for Brighton & Hove.\r\n \r\nThe Commissioners wish to appoint a Service Provider suitably experienced in leading and developing advocacy provision with an excellent track record of providing the relevant statutory and non-statutory advocacy services. Service Providers will need to demonstrate how the model will be implemented and work in practice and particularly how the Service Provider will manage its supply chain, if any, to ensure compliance with the contract requirements in terms of quality. \r\n\r\nThe Service Provider will need to demonstrate their understanding of the unique and diverse make-up each local authority area and how they will ensure that their proposed service will be accessible, engaging and reflect need and also demonstrate impact of the Services.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: The Procurement Contract Regulations 2015 classifies some social care services and other specific services as \"Light Touch\".  These services are subject to different, more flexible rules and thresholds than ordinary public contracts under the Act. The Advocacy services required fall under 'Light Touch Regime'. \r\n\r\nThis procurement is governed by the Procurement Contract Regulations 2015.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners are using the Open Procedure.\r\n\r\nThe contract for the provision of Advocacy Services will be for an initial period of five (5) years, plus an optional extension period of two (2) years. The Contract will be for a maximum of seven (7) years.\r\n  \r\nAny interested organisation with the experience, capability and capacity to deliver the ambition laid out in the tender documents may submit a tender return in response to this contract notice. \r\nThe Commissioners welcome collaborations and partnerships, subject to them appointing a lead provider to act on their behalf as the lead contracting party taking overall responsibility for delivery of the Advocacy services in accordance with the requirements of the Contract. \r\n\r\nPlease see the published tender documentation for details of award criteria.",

    "description": "Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (the Trust) requires ongoing, expert maintenance and servicing of the \"Archimedes screw\" pumping stations located at Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) to ensure their continued operation and to mitigate the risk of failure. These pumping stations play a critical role in preventing surface water flooding by efficiently moving excess water away from the facility.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a failure, the pumping stations could become inoperable, which would significantly increase the risk of surface water flooding at the site. This could cause the perimeter roads surrounding QMC to be blocked by floodwaters, obstructing access to the hospital. In the worst case, water could back up into the QMC building itself, potentially flooding internal areas and disrupting hospital operations. Such flooding could lead to significant damage to the infrastructure, compromise patient care, and create substantial operational challenges.\r\n\r\nTo prevent such scenarios and ensure the continued functionality of the pumping systems, the Trust has entered into a two-year service agreement with Spaans Ltd. This contract includes an option for two additional 12-month extensions, providing flexibility for continued support beyond the initial term. Spaans Ltd is responsible for the regular inspection, servicing, and maintenance of the Archimedes screw pumping stations, ensuring they operate optimally and can handle the required capacity during periods of heavy rainfall or adverse weather conditions.\r\n\r\nThis proactive maintenance approach is crucial to safeguarding the hospital's infrastructure, maintaining patient and staff safety, and ensuring the resilience of QMC in the face of potential flooding risks.",

North Central London Integrated Care Board and the Department of Work & Penson, Work & Health Unit, have significantly increased investment to enable more people to successfully find and sustain paid employment.\r\nThe new contract is broken down into two service elements\r\nâ¢\tModel 1: Mental Health Individual Placement Support Service - in Secondary Care \r\nâ¢\tModel 2: Mental Health Individual Placement Support Service - in NHS Talking Therapies Service \r\nThe maximum total combined budget for these services is Â£2,192,956.

LB Camden considers this service to be a Mixed Procurement in accordance with the PSR.  The PSR has introduced three provider selection processes that relevant authorities can follow to award contract for health care services. LB Camden considers that the Competitive Process is applicable for the purposes of this contract as there are a number of providers with the capability to satisfy the contract requirements to a sufficient standard so does not consider Direct Award processes A, B or C are appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe Council has reviewed and upgraded its payment processes and is now able to offer the Supplier Incentive Scheme. For a small rebate our target is to pay invoices within 10 days, or earlier, after the receipt of a valid invoice. The Council therefore recommends Suppliers participate in the Supplier Incentive Scheme to improve their cash flow and ensure enhanced liquidity within your supply chain. Participation in the Supplier Incentive Scheme has therefore been included as part of this process and Suppliers are referred to the tender pack for further information.",

    "description": "NHSE seeks to procure the provision of an on-line 10-week university-based programme of training for those midwives and nurses working in maternity and neonatal services to train as Professional midwifery Advocate and Professional Nurse Advocate.

    "description": "This notice is placed in order to facilitate early engagement with potential providers and relates only to an engagement workshop.\r\n\r\nFrom 6-8pm on Thursday 7 November 2024, NHS Sussex will hold a dental engagement event at Lewes Town Hall (postcode: BN7 2QS). This will offer dental professionals the opportunity to share the challenges they face in delivering NHS dental services and how as commissioners we can identify opportunities to support the development of NHS dental services and increase provision in the district of Lewes. \r\n\r\nIf you wish to secure your place at the engagement event please click on the link to book by midday on Friday 1 November 2024:\r\nhttps://yoursaysussex.govocal.com/en-GB/projects/nhs-sussex-integrated-care-board-dental-professionals-engagement-event\r\n\r\nOne of the priorities in NHS Sussex's Dental Recovery and Transformation Plan is to enhance access to NHS Dental services.\r\n\r\nAs part of this plan we aim to increase access in targeted areas of need in Sussex. Since Lewes has seen a reduction in the provision of NHS dental services, we are convening a dental professional engagement event on the 7 November 2024.\r\n\r\nThe event is aimed at current and prospective primary care dental providers in Sussex and is intended to:\r\nâ¢\tProvide NHS Sussex dental commissioners with a better understanding of the current challenges facing NHS dental services in Lewes.\r\nâ¢\tListen to dental providers who are interested in providing primary NHS dental services in Lewes about current and future delivery of services in the area.\r\nâ¢\tExplain the current situation regarding access to primary dental services. \r\nâ¢\tIdentify barriers and opportunities to help facilitate access to NHS dental services in the area.\r\nâ¢\tIdentify opportunities to build resilience in dental services in the area, including using flexible commissioning to address local population oral health needs.\r\n\r\nThe event will assist the Commissioners to achieve a better understanding of the provider market. It will be an opportunity to meet with the Commissioners and stakeholders, hear more about NHS dental services in East Sussex and discuss the critical issues, challenges and opportunities that relate to future commissioning and provision of these services.\r\n\r\nThis exercise is being carried out by NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of the Commissioner.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nThis notice is an information gathering exercise rather than a call for competition in its own right, and therefore publication or response does not commit the Authority or respondents to a future procurement, nor provide any process exemptions or preferential treatment to any parties expressing an interest. The Authority will not be liable for costs incurred by any interested party in participating in this exercise.  \r\n\r\nThis is a Provider Selection Regime (PSR) prior information notice. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 do not apply.",

    "description": "The St George's Antenatal Fetal Evaluation (SAFE) test is a Non Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) service based at St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, screening for Down's, Edwards' and Patau's syndromes, in line with UK National Screening Committee (UKNSC) recommendations and NHS England requirements. In some instances, fetal sexing is performed in addition to the main trisomy's. The SAFE test has been set up as a collaboration between the Fetal Medicine Unit and the St George's Genomics Service, which is a UKAS accredited medical laboratory. The service provides NIPT to approximately one third of the NHS maternity services in England and several private clinical services performing 4,000-5,000 tests annually. \r\n\r\nThis invitation to tender gives the requirement to supply a complete laboratory test setup including reagent test kits for NIPT, all equipment, associated software and LIMS and equipment servicing. The test should be commercially available and CE marked for In Vitro diagnostic use ideally compliant to ISO13485. It should detect aneuploidy of chromosomes 13, 18 and 21 and be able to determine fetal sex within the specified sensitivity and specificity thresholds as a minimum requirement.\r\n\r\nThe supplier must provide reagents, software and protocols sufficient to produce an end result on suitable equipment designated by the supplier. Resulting data must be clearly reportable and be usable by The SAFE Test personnel in a flexible and secure manner. \r\n\r\nThe service must be provided to diagnostic standards, incorporating a complete CE/IVDD compliant workflow, to ensure data can be used for clinical interpretation. Samples must be analysed within the given timeframe, data must meet the minimum specified requirements and results issued in a customisable and easily interpretable format.  \r\n\r\nThe majority of samples processed are commissioned by NHSE with a contract running until March 2026. In the event St George's is not re-procured by NHSE to provide this service beyond this point, it is likely that the service may have to terminate its contract with the supplier.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nTo express interest and participate in the tender, please register and apply via Atamis e-sourcing portal https://health-family.force.com/s/Welcome.\r\n\r\nShould Tenderers have any queries, or having problems using the portal, they should contact Helpdesk at:\r\n\r\nPhone: 0800 9956035\r\n\r\nE-mail: support-health@atamis.co.uk",

    "description": "NHS Frimley Integrated Care Board (ICB) is seeking a digitalised end-to-end digital system, where information seamlessly flows between processes by connecting the entire lifecycle into one platform.  The system needs to facilitate the services to deliver enhanced transformation across all spectrums of the service.\r\n\r\nFrimley's CHC Service provides high quality, safe care to Frimley's most vulnerable Adults and Children, and currently has a combined active caseload of around 1,500 individuals.  It is clear with this caseload, and the inherent complexities associated with the services, that an efficient and effective digital system is essential.\r\n\r\nOne of the key requirements for a new system will be the need for it to be sufficiently flexible to support a wide range of services outside the traditional CHC / Funded Nursing Care (FNC) / Fast Track (FT) / Continuing Care (CC) agenda.  Service wide transformation will be implemented across all areas including clinical, business, performance, finance and contracting and commissioning. This will also include other Health funding services, such as Mental Health S117, Complex Care and IRAP.\r\n\r\nEnabling better integration between systems across Health and Social Care is also critical. CHC/S117/Complex Care are unique services and links many elements of the health and social care system together, with some of these services overlapping with each other e.g. a patient can have health funding from S117 and CHC.  Interoperability is of paramount importance, allowing for the CHC service and wider Health and Social Care teams to share and view records to support improved accessibility and visibility of data which in turn will enable more efficient and streamlined workflows for all teams and a better person experience.\r\n\r\nThe contract term will be for 3 years with an optional extension of any period up to 2 years.\r\n\r\nThe estimated contract value is Â£175,000 per annum inc. VAT giving an estimated maximum contract value of Â£525,000 inc. VAT for the initial contract period and an estimated Â£875,000 inc. VAT if the full extension period is adopted.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the system will be live from 1st July 2025.\r\n\r\nInterested providers will be able to view this opportunity via the live opportunities list on the 'Health Family' e-procurement system, Atamis. Click on 'View our Live Opportunities' from the home page, available on the following link: https://health-family.force.com/s/Welcome.\r\n\r\nOnce you have found the opportunity (via the search function, using the title or reference number), to gain full access to the bid documentation (including questionnaires), you will need to click on 'Register interest' - this will take you to the log-in page. \r\n\r\nIf you are not already registered on the system, you will need to do so before gaining full access to the documentation and be able to submit a bid. \r\n\r\nThis procurement is being carried out by NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of the Commissioners.",

    "description": "The Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (The Trust) is conducting this request for information (RFI) exercise regarding the provision of a contract for both planned testing servicing and maintenance, as well as any reactive servicing, of the nurse call systems. The purpose of the contract is to enable the Trust to meet its needs as a provider of healthcare services. For example, enabling ward staff to respond quickly in event of a signal from patients for support or assistance.\r\n\r\nFurther information, including a supplier questionnaire, can be obtained via the Trust's e-tendering portal:\r\n\r\nhttps://health-family.force.com/s/Welcome\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems with the Electronic Portal., you should contact the helpdesk on 0800 9956035 or by sending an email to support-health@atamis.co.uk . The helpline is open Monday to Friday between 8 am and 6 pm excluding public and bank holidays.\r\n\r\nThe primary remit of NHS organisations with regard to nurse call systems is the safety of patients. For all premises under its control, it is therefore critical that the Trust's nurse call systems are effectively serviced and maintained. Whilst it is not a legal requirement to service nurse call systems, it is understood they must be regularly maintained to ensure continued functionality.\r\n\r\nWithout regular maintenance, the system can fail when needed, risking patients' lives. In addition, lack of maintenance can result in false alarms, leading to staff becoming desensitised to the system and the associated risk they may ignore it when a real emergency occurs.\r\n\r\nThe Trust's objectives are to maintain a high level of reliability and availability of its systems by operating a system of planned preventative maintenance, with response to call outs and call backs/breakdowns maintained at agreed performance levels, whilst ensuring value for money.\r\n\r\n\t1. The systems currently in situ at the Nottingham City Hospital consist primarily of Static Systems\r\n2. The systems currently in situ at the queens Medical Centre consist of a mixture of Wandsworth, Ipin and Static Systems",

Objectives for Sustainable Procurement  Sustainability in purchasing need not necessarily cost more and there is now a much wider choice of environmentally friendly products. \"Green goods\" are not necessarily more expensive; often if the 'whole life cost' of a product is considered the cheapest product is more expensive in the long run. Whole life costing means taking into account the total cost of an item over its lifetime such as raw materials sourcing, running costs, transportation, admin costs and disposal costs.  The overarching objective is for sustainability considerations to be addressed within the procurement cycle in all instances.   The more specific objectives in terms of sustainable procurement are:  To seek alternatives to products and processes which are detrimental to the environment and social wellâbeing by using more environmentally friendly and ethically traded products and processes. To minimise waste, including: any packaging, waste produced by the product (or service) in question, and waste generated by the eventual disposal of the product.",

Reduce fragmentation in services and increase access to professionals competent and confident in identifying and responding to the needs of adult victims and survivors;\r\n2. Every interaction matters. Promotion of trauma-informed and strengths-based approaches that acknowledge the need for personalisation, collaboration, and choice;\r\n3. Focus on collaboration and co-production.\r\n\r\nMarket Engagement:\r\n\r\nTo test assumptions and proposed service requirements, a market engagement event will take place to explore the market's feedback on the following areas:\r\n\r\nâ¢ Outline of service requirements and key outcomes;\r\nâ¢ Timescales for procurement and mobilisation of the new contract;\r\nâ¢ Proposed contract duration and financial model;\r\nâ¢ Networking opportunity with providers.\r\n\r\nThe Authority plans to hold an interactive engagement event on Wednesday 19 February 2025 from 10:30 - 14:00 at Wellington House, Lower Ground, 133 - 155 Waterloo Road, London, SE1 8UG.\r\n\r\nMaximum 2 attendees per organisation.\r\n\r\nRegistration closes at 12:00pm (Noon) on 10 February 2025.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: The indicative maximum financial envelope for this procurement will be Â£1,017,000 per annum. \r\n\r\nThe contract will have an initial term of 3 years, with the possibility of extending the term up to a further 2 years beyond the initial contracted duration. This will be subject to satisfactory performance and by mutual agreement between the Commissioners and Providers, but the intention is for this service and the partnership that supports it to be part of longer-term transformation work. \r\n\r\nThe service specification, HNA and other supporting documents will be shared in advance of the MEE.\r\n\r\nOrganisation or agency biographies submitted in the Registration Form will be shared in a directory of services to aid provider networking.\r\n\r\nThe NHS London Commercial Hub (LCH), hosted by NHS North East London ICB is managing this Market Engagement process on behalf of NHS England (London Region).",

These wireless devices provide timely, reliable, and secure messaging in critical situations, enabling quick receipt of alerts, emergency messages, and patient updates. Pagers help staff respond quickly in urgent situations, especially in areas with poor mobile signal, by prioritising urgent messages. They improve response times, streamline workflows, ensure clear communication, and ultimately support better patient care and management of critical situations.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nThe initial contract involved leasing cloud-based servers to process the pagers, along with audio distribution units and other peripheral equipment. Although it was recommended to install onsite servers as well, this was not implemented, leading to complete reliance on the internet-based solution. Pagers are essential for crash teams in the emergency departments and must operate efficiently 24/7. Due to unexpected internet disruptions, there have been two critical incidents where the crash teams arrived just in time, raising concerns about patient health and safety being at risk. As a result, the project team decided to install two onsite servers to ensure the pagers function reliably.",

    "description": "There has been significant year on\r\nyear increases in the number of people waiting for an autism assessment.\r\nDemand for assessment continues to outstrip capacity in the workforce\r\nneeded to deliver them. It is vital that autism assessment pathways are\r\ndelivered through a quality and equity lens, considering evidence-based\r\npractice and research.\r\nUCL is launching an autism assessment and post-diagnostic support clinic\r\nin October 2025. There are several elements that could provide essential\r\nlearning for systems and services, providing that they are evaluated\r\nrobustly.\r\nThe third level student population represent a specific challenge to the\r\ndynamics of adult waiting lists. In many places waiting times are now longer\r\nthan the duration of study which creates a variety of unpredictable demand\r\ncharacteristics. Removing student populations from local specialist autism\r\nteams could positively impact the waiting list.\r\nAn evaluation looking at the Clinic's success in contributing to more timely,\r\nless costly and more effective autism assessment services, with enhanced\r\nexperience at each stage of support would support decision making around\r\nthe assessment pathway and could lead to national policy development.\r\nUCL (which has unrivalled clinical and research expertise in\r\nneurodevelopmental and mental health conditions) is in a unique position to\r\nbe able to provide an evaluation of this type. In addition, it will provide evidence about how best to support neurodivergent students (including autistic people) which is also crucial, given that a recent review found 30% of serious incident reports (of suicide and non-fatal self-harm) in higher education students described a diagnosis of, or suspected, neurodiversity (including autism and ADHD)",

    "description": "Derby City Council (the Council) is undertaking this procurement on behalf of itself and the Derby and Derbyshire NHS Integrated Commissioning Board to establish a contract for the provision of an Emotional Health and Wellbeing Service for Children in Care. \r\n\r\nWe seek a single provider, lead provider, or consortium to deliver a trauma informed service which embeds and delivers interventions to children in care (CIC) and their therapeutic parenting team which meets their individual emotional and mental health needs and creates stability in placements.  \r\n\r\nThe service will ensure the needs of the child are paramount, using a range of interventions via direct or indirect work. This will deliver to all children in care who meet the inclusion criteria, including those children who are placed within the Local Authority boundaries from other areas. It will also include those who are cared for by the Local Authorities approved foster carers, that live never more than 5 miles outside of the Derbyshire Footprint.\r\n\r\nThe overall aim of the service is to improve the emotional health and wellbeing of CIC via direct support to the child and / or indirect support to the therapeutic parenting team.\r\n\r\nThe service will offer a range of appropriate evidence based, trauma informed interventions, both group and one to one.  The service is not expected to prescribe medications, nor does it need to be CQC registered.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the core specification, we are including a two year \"proof of concept\" service for Children in Care with complex needs through a Coordination and Advisory Team. The contract period for this element is 19 months; commencing in line with the core requirement on 1st September 2025 and expiring 31st March 2027. (the incumbent provider is expecting to commence the service within its existing service delivery from April 2025).\r\n\r\nFor information: The agreement with the successful bidder will have, as parties to it, Derby City Council, NHS Derby and Derbyshire Integrated Care Board and Derbyshire County Council. Derby City Council and Derbyshire County Council will refer young people to the service and both, with the additional of the NHS Derby and Derbyshire Integrated Care Board, will be responsible for the contract management.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: Please note suppliers wishing to express interest and obtain the documentation must do so by 11.30pm on Monday 24th March 2025. It is recommended that you express interest and obtain the documentation well before this time to allow sufficient time to prepare and submit a bid. \r\n\r\nThe deadline for returns is 10.00am on Tuesday 25th March 2025.  \r\n\r\nDocuments are available at www.eastmidstenders.org\r\n\r\nPlease search for TD2159\r\n\r\nPlease note: we will only accept expressions of interest through the e-tendering system.",

The Mersey Regional Burns and Plastic Surgery Unit at Whiston Hospital and the Northwest Regional Spinal Injuries Centre at Southport Hospital serves a population of over 4 million across the whole of Cheshire and Merseyside, The Isle of Man and North Wales.  Objectives for Sustainable Procurement  Sustainability in purchasing need not necessarily cost more and there is now a much wider choice of environmentally friendly products. \"Green goods\" are not necessarily more expensive; often if the 'whole life cost' of a product is considered the cheapest product is more expensive in the long run. Whole life costing means taking into account the total cost of an item over its lifetime such as raw materials sourcing, running costs, transportation, admin costs and disposal costs.  The overarching objective is for sustainability considerations to be addressed within the procurement cycle in all instances.   The more specific objectives in terms of sustainable procurement are:  To seek alternatives to products and processes which are detrimental to the environment and social wellâbeing by using more environmentally friendly and ethically traded products and processes. To minimise waste, including: any packaging, waste produced by the product (or service) in question, and waste generated by the eventual disposal of the product.  MWL are looking for a partner to carry out planned preventative maintenance and inspections to the fire dampers at Southport District General Hospital and Ormskirk District General Hospital. Inspections will be required to develop a detailed list of remedial work that has been identified and it will be the suppliers responsibility to carry out all of the remedials as per the specification.",

    "description": "The South East London Integrated Care System (ICS) brings together the health and care partners that serve our vibrant and highly diverse populations resident in the London boroughs of Bexley, Bromley, Greenwich, Lambeth, Lewisham, and Southwark - our Places. \r\n \r\nOur partnership brings together six local authorities, over 200 general practices (operating within 35 Primary Care Networks), Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital NHS FT, King's College Hospital NHS FT, Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust, South London and the Maudsley Mental Health FT and Oxleas FT. Importantly, the ICS seeks to be connected to the communities we serve (circa 1.92m residents) and work with the widest possible range of community, voluntary and third sector groups and organisations in each borough. \r\n\r\nPrimary care is at the heart of the NHS. It remains the first place to turn for the vast majority of patients when they become unwell, providing accessible and expert generalist care. The concept of a registered list is still the cornerstone of this model, enabling GPs and their staff to build continuous, trusting relationships with patients, intimately knowing their needs and circumstances. It is a model that has proven remarkably resilient to a constantly changing landscape of clinical advances and patient expectations.\r\n\r\nIn Lambeth we are very fortunate to have high quality GP Practices, with a dedicated workforce who consistently achieve good clinical outcomes and satisfaction ratings. We also have strong at-scale provision and leadership through our 9 PCNs, our GP Federation, and our local LMC, who regularly show their enthusiasm and energy to work together in partnership to improve services for our population.\r\n\r\nWe expect the successful applicant to maintain, demonstrate and build on these high quality services for people who reside in nursing homes within the borough of Lambeth as per the service specification.\r\n\r\nInterested organisation must express an interest via Atamis  e-tendering portal.

These will need to be regularly checked and updated by the provider.\r\nâ¢\tS12 Doctors should be able to add their availability calendar to the system which means professionals can see which Doctors are available to be called upon at any time. \r\nâ¢\tThe AMHP - (Allied Mental Health Professional - accredited social worker under the powers of the MHA) should be able to open and manage their S12 caseload on the system.\r\nâ¢\tDoctors must be able to add their information on the system when they have completed their assessment, leading to automatic payment in the next monthly scheduled payment run.\r\nâ¢\tThe software provider will need to provide training for Doctors, AMHPs and admin staff to use the system effectively and provide online support to all users.\r\nâ¢\tThe ICB will need to receive detailed activity reports regarding numbers, times and dates of assessments along with providers which can aid resource allocation. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this advert is to invite the market to engage and provide feedback on the draft specification. This will provide the ICB with valuable information to ensure that the service and specification is fit for purpose.\r\n\r\nThe deadline for market engagement responses is by 17:00 hours on Tuesday 6th May 2025. Please note this is a market testing exercise and does not commit the ICB to carry out any further procurement process.

    "description": "North West London Integrated Care Board (ICB) seeks the views of Providers in commissioning for the provision of local community beds (step-up, step-down rehabilitation) for a wide range of conditions which are located in acute, intermediate care and community facilities. The aim of the service is to provide medical, nursing, and therapeutic inpatient rehabilitation for patients that are registered with a North West London GP.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to provide multidisciplinary assessments of patients from the local Trust and discharge patients to the most appropriate setting via the trusted assessor team based at Northwick Park Hospital.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, NHS Harrow borough originally developed a new integrated care pathway for adults and frail elderly people to avoid hospital admissions, support early discharge and promote effective rehabilitation and reablement, wherever possible in a community setting. The main acute hospital, London North West University Hospital Trust, was consistently subject to increasing demands for rehabilitation and acute treatment beds.\r\n\r\nSince its inception the Intermediate Care Beds has provided a route for patients who have received Acute Care from both elective and non-elective procedures or treatment. Predominantly the Intermediate Care Beds have ensured that patients are not occupying Acute Beds for lengthy periods of time when their onward therapy needs can be met within this current service.\r\n\r\nAs North West London moved to managing their community rehabilitation beds capacity across the system, the beds commissioned by Harrow borough were opened up from patient's with a Harrow GP only, to patient's registered with any North West London GP.\r\n\r\nNHS NWL ICB and its partners all recognise the need to evolve this service to provide a wider range of nursing care services to patients.\r\n\r\nThe ICB is now exploring the opportunity to re-procure this service and is would very much appreciate the views and feedback from possible providers of the services.\r\n\r\nNorth West London Integrated Care Board is therefore undertaking a market engagement exercise via a Request for Information questionnaire (RFI).\r\n\r\nThis is a process designed to help North West London Integrated Care Board (ICB) form a view of the best way to commission the service; it is not the beginning of a tender exercise. A further tender advertisement will be issued at the appropriate time where required.\r\n\r\nTo access the documents and participate, please register and apply via Atamis e-sourcing portal:\r\n\r\nhttps://health-family.force.com/s/Welcome\r\n\r\nNorth West London Procurement Services (NWLPS) is a Collaborative Procurement Organisation. The ICB has instructed NWLPS to act as their procurement representative, therefore, any communications during this market engagement stage is on behalf of the ICB. \r\n\r\nPlease complete your responses by 31st March 2025.\r\n\r\nThank you for your participation.",

Although it is not a legal requirement to service the nurse call systems, regular maintenance is essential to reduce the risk of faults and system downtime, ensuring they function effectively when needed most. \r\n\r\nThe City Hospital currently lacks the internal capacity to service and maintain these systems, making it necessary to engage an external contractor. Static Systems Group Limited has been identified as a primary  supplier, being the sole contractor to respond and have the capabilitties to undertake the servcie through the competitive quotation process. \r\n\r\nThe procurement process involved inviting multiple contractors to quote, but only Static Systems Group Limited responded. \r\n\r\nThe contract period is from 14 February 2024 and will be for a term of 24 months.",

Support will focus on stabilisation to enable transition to a longer-term placement.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs part of the procurement process, we would like to consult initially with the market on the feasibility of the model of delivery with a D2 tender with a number of questions we would like potential providers to respond to. \r\n\r\nA more detailed overview of the requirement is provided in the attached summary document. \r\n\r\nWe have also provided a response document for interested parties to complete and return. \r\n\r\nWe are asking for responses to be sent to by email to Catherine.young@derby.gov.uk no later than 5.00pm Friday 31st January 2025.",

Service Specifications\r\n \r\nService Specification No. 2\r\n \r\nService\r\nCommunity Diagnostic Centre Non-Obstetric Ultrasound\r\nCommissioner Lead\r\nDoncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (DBTH)\r\nProvider Lead\r\n \r\nPeriod\r\n1st January 2025- 31st December 2025\r\nDate of Review\r\nAnnually\r\n \r\n \r\n1.  Population Needs\r\n \r\nNational/local context and evidence base\r\n \r\nThe creation of Community Diagnostic Centres (CDC's) was recommended following Professor Sir Mike Richards' Review of NHS diagnostics capacity. The recommendation was that NHS organisations across England move to providing diagnostic services in CDC's and all health systems are expected to include a network of CDC's as part of their health services offer.\r\n \r\nIn 2021, Mexborough Montagu Hospital (MMH) was selected to host one of a pair of CDC's within South Yorkshire, following a Â£3 million investment from the South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw Integrated Care System. In November 2023 phase 2 of the CDC opened in MMH providing a fully functional endoscopy suite, with training facilities and multifunctional clinic rooms including ultrasound facilities. Once completed, in late 2024/early 2025, the CDC will also provide Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging facilities. \r\n \r\nThis service specification relates to the provision of the Non-Obstetric Ultrasound (NOUS) element of the CDC imaging service only.\r\n \r\n  \r\n2. Key Service Outcomes\r\n \r\n \r\n2.1 Locally defined outcomes\r\n \r\nOutcome\r\nMeasurable Output\r\nProvide a high quality NOUS service for patients attending the CDC.\r\nDeliver 75 hours of NOUS scanning time over 5 days per week.\r\nExpected throughput: 52 scans/day\r\nAll scans reported on the same day\r\nStaff rotas delivered at least 14 days prior to session dates \r\nParticipate in performance monitoring and audit as required\r\nAttendance at performance / audit meetings\r\n \r\n \r\n2.1 Contract monitoring\r\nDBTH will work with the contractor to jointly monitor compliance with the above locally defined outcomes. This will include agreement regarding situations where it is deemed that an acceptable exception has occurred. Where this is the case, locally defined outcomes reporting will be retrospectively updated to remove acceptable exceptions from both numerators and denominators, however each case will still be reflected through the report's narrative.  Acceptable exceptions will include patient refusals, DNAs and patient choice.\r\n \r\n \r\n3. Scope\r\n3.1 Aims and objectives of service\r\nThe aim of this Service is to provide high quality NOUS examinations and reports for patients attending the CDC located with Mexborough Montague Hospital. Patients will be scanned and images reported by the sub-contractor using CDC equipment and facilities, in accordance with Society and College of Radiographers (SOR) and British Medical Ultrasound Society (BMUS) guidelines for professional ultrasound practice. \r\n ",

    "description": "An Intended Approach Notice to follow the Most Suitable Provider (MSP) Process, pursuant to The Health Care Services (Provider Selection Regime) Regulations 2023 (the Regulations) has been published in Find a Tender Service and is attached to this engagement notice. The Contracting Authority, NHS Mid and South Essex Integrated Care Board (the Authority) is using the most suitable provider process (the Process) as defined by Regulations 6(6) and 10) to award a Land Option (\"the Contract\") via a mixed procurement (commencing 25th March 2025), for the development and delivery of a General Practitioner Medical Surgery and associated facilities and services under a General Medical Services (GMS) contract (the Requirement).\r\n\r\nFor avoidance of doubt, the MSP process will not result in the Authority and the most suitable provider (MSP) entering into a new contract. The Authority is responsible for running the Process as the legal entity responsible for commissioning Primary Medical Services in Mid and South Essex. The Authority and existing GP Practices that have expressed an initial interest in being considered as the MSP are already within contractual arrangements via each Practice&apos;s existing GMS/PMS. Instead, the Process intends to identify and award the opportunity to enter a Land Option with Bloor Homes and Rochford District Council. The Authority is expecting the council/developer to transfer the land directly to the MSP following the successful conclusion of this exercise. The MSP will be responsible for working with the council to develop the site for delivery under their existing GMS /PMS contract. Further work will be needed as the site develops to amend the MSP&apos;s existing contract to reflect any proposed plans (for example, whether it is an additional branch site or a relocation).\r\n\r\nThe deadline for any potential practices to express an interest in this opportunity is midnight on the 14th day beginning the day after the Intended Approach Notice was published (04.03.25). Please direct enquiries to the named contact within this Notice for further information by the deadline. Phase 1 - Qualification is intended to commence with the basic selection criteria being published to the identified Practices on 25th March 2025. The deadline for responses to the Qualification phase is 14th April 2025, at 12:00 Noon.\r\n\r\nThe basic selection criteria that potential practices must demonstrate they can meet to be considered within Phase 1 - Qualification of this process are contained within the attached document titled Supplementary Information for the PIN _ Ashingdon Road 04.03 but at a high level, the most suitable provider must hold a current GMS/PMS contract for general medical services with an active patient list and be currently operating within the two Primary Care Networks (PCN), Rayleigh & District, and Rochford.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nFor avoidance of doubt, this Process will not result in the Authority and the most suitable provider (MSP) entering into a new contract. The Authority is responsible for running the Process as the legal entity responsible for commissioning Primary Medical Services in Mid and South Essex. The Authority and existing GP Practices that have expressed an initial interest in being considered as the MSP are already within contractual arrangements via each Practice&apos;s existing GMS. Instead, the Process intends to identify and award the opportunity to enter a Land Option with Bloor Homes and Rochford District Council. The Authority is expecting the council/developer to transfer the land directly to the MSP following the successful conclusion of this exercise. The MSP will be responsible for working with the council to develop the site for delivery under their existing GMS contract. Further work will be needed as the site develops to amend the MSP&apos;s existing contract to reflect any proposed plans (for example, whether it is an additional branch site or a relocation).\r\n\r\nUnder a Section 106 Agreement, Rochford District Council and the developer Bloor Homes have made available an opportunity via a land option (expiring November 2025) and a  financial contribution of Â£262,300 available to the MSP that purchases the land, to support the improvement of healthcare services in Rochford, which is the value that has been communicate in this Notice as the estimated total value. The MSP will be required to source the necessary capital to implement the requirement through solutions such as partnering with a specialist healthcare facility developer or some form of borrowings. No further capital resource is available through the NHS to support build costs. Solutions  could be to either relocate existing services or develop a branch surgery premises subject to following appropriate contractual processes for any proposed relocation, including any necessary public engagement as well as compliance with relevant ICB and NHSE governance.\r\n\r\nThis is supplementary to the Provider Selection Regime (PSR) intended approach notice published on 04.03.25. The process is subject to the Health Care Services (Provider Selection Regime) Regulations 2023. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 do not apply. The award decision-maker for this process is NHS Mid and South Essex Integrated Care Board (ICB).  Please see the attached document titled Supplementary Information for the PIN _ Ashingdon Road 04.03 for further details including the full list of basic selection criteria that providers must be able to meet to be considered the most suitable provider, and the Authorities detailed justification for undertaking a mixed procurement under PSR.",
