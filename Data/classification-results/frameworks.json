Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

    "description": "This Invitation to Quote (ITQ) has been prepared by NHS England and NHS Improvement (the 'Authority'). \r\n\r\nThe Authority is looking for a Supplier for the set-up provision of a national NHS engineering graduate pilot scheme. \r\n\r\nProposed engagement for this programme set up will be from October 2024 until December 2026.  \r\n\r\nThe scheme aim is to support a minimum of seven graduates in the first cohort from Sep 2025, running from this date to Aug 2028 with potential annual cohorts thereafter subject to need and available budget. \r\n\r\nThe supplier will oversee the recruitment, management, and support of graduates, who will be placed in NHS trusts. The trusts will pay the graduates' salaries, and an additional one-off fee will ensure the programme's sustainability. It is the one-off fee from trusts that will support the programme post Dec 2026. The funding available in the ITQ ( Invitation to Quote)  is for set up costs only. \r\n\r\nEducational components are apprenticeship levy funded. The supplier will need to engage with educational provider(s) and other stakeholders to support successful educational aspect to the programme. \r\n\r\nThe supplier will deliver marketing, recruitment, mentorship, and pastoral care for the graduates, as well as monitor and evaluate the programme.\r\n\r\nContext:\r\n\r\nThe 2022 NHS Estates and Facilities Workforce Action Plan emphasises two critical actions:\r\n\r\n1.\tBuilding the next generation of Estates, Facilities, and Maintenance (EFM) professionals.\r\n2.\tEmbedding equality, diversity, and inclusion into recruitment and development processes.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these goals, a bespoke NHS Estates graduate scheme is crucial for attracting new talent. The scheme aligns with several key priorities:\r\n\r\ni)\tIncrease technical engineering capacity within NHS Estates, which will help reduce operational risks, cut costs, and improve patient safety, care quality, and overall experience. \r\n\r\nii)\tEnhance leadership development within the Estates and Facilities division, creating a robust leadership pipeline.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the NHS employs approximately 500 engineers who utilise technical and project management skills to develop and maintain the NHS estate. However, significant challenges remain in recruiting and retaining a skilled technical workforce due to a national shortage of talent and unfavorable labour market conditions. As a result, NHS Estates has become highly reliant on external contractors, underscoring the need to cultivate talent internally.\r\n\r\nFurther detail and the tender documents can be downloaded from the link below : - \r\n\r\nhttps://health-family.force.com/s/Welcome\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nTo express interest and participate in the tender, please register and apply via Atamis e-sourcing portal https://health-family.force.com/s/Welcome.\r\n\r\nShould Tenderers have any queries, or having problems using the portal, they should contact Helpdesk at:\r\n\r\nPhone: 0800 9956035\r\n\r\nE-mail: support-health@atamis.co.uk",

    "description": "Buckinghamshire Council (the Council) is seeking to establish a Dynamic Purchasing Vehicle (\"DPV\") for the provision of home care Services in Buckinghamshire (\"the Services\"). The Council is conducting the procurement via the \"Light Touch Regime\" as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015).\r\nSuppliers will be expected to deliver Services for people assessed as being eligible for health or social care support under the provisions of The Care Act (2014) or The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care (2022). Additionally, Suppliers will support Individuals being discharged from hospital through the Home First pathway who are awaiting an assessment of need. The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\").\r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways.\r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered.\r\nThe Lots are:\r\nLot 1: Standard home care\r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care\r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business.\r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied.\r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot.\r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out.\r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website:\r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk\r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation.\r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

    "description": "Buckinghamshire Council (the Council) is seeking to establish a Dynamic Purchasing Vehicle (\"DPV\") for the provision of home care Services in Buckinghamshire (\"the Services\"). The Council is conducting the procurement via the \"Light Touch Regime\" as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015). \r\nSuppliers will be expected to deliver Services for people assessed as being eligible for health or social care support under the provisions of The Care Act (2014) or The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care (2022). Additionally, Suppliers will support Individuals being discharged from hospital through the Home First pathway who are awaiting an assessment of need. The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

The Council is conducting the procurement via the \"Light Touch Regime\" as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015). \r\nSuppliers will be expected to deliver Services for people assessed as being eligible for health or social care support under the provisions of The Care Act (2014) or The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care (2022). Additionally, Suppliers will support Individuals being discharged from hospital through the Home First pathway who are awaiting an assessment of need. The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV.

All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

    "description": "Buckinghamshire Council (the Council) is seeking to establish a Dynamic Purchasing Vehicle (\"DPV\") for the provision of home care Services in Buckinghamshire (\"the Services\"). The Council is conducting the procurement via the \"Light Touch Regime\" as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015). \r\nSuppliers will be expected to deliver Services for people assessed as being eligible for health or social care support under the provisions of The Care Act (2014) or The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care (2022). Additionally, Suppliers will support Individuals being discharged from hospital through the Home First pathway who are awaiting an assessment of need. The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1).

    "description": "Buckinghamshire Council (the Council) is seeking to establish a Dynamic Purchasing Vehicle (\"DPV\") for the provision of home care Services in Buckinghamshire (\"the Services\"). The Council is conducting the procurement via the \"Light Touch Regime\" as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015). \r\nSuppliers will be expected to deliver Services for people assessed as being eligible for health or social care support under the provisions of The Care Act (2014) or The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care (2022). Additionally, Suppliers will support Individuals being discharged from hospital through the Home First pathway who are awaiting an assessment of need. The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

    "description": "Buckinghamshire Council (the Council) is seeking to establish a Dynamic Purchasing Vehicle (\"DPV\") for the provision of home care Services in Buckinghamshire (\"the Services\"). The Council is conducting the procurement via the \"Light Touch Regime\" as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015). \r\nSuppliers will be expected to deliver Services for people assessed as being eligible for health or social care support under the provisions of The Care Act (2014) or The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care (2022). Additionally, Suppliers will support Individuals being discharged from hospital through the Home First pathway who are awaiting an assessment of need. The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

    "description": "Buckinghamshire Council (the Council) is seeking to establish a Dynamic Purchasing Vehicle (\"DPV\") for the provision of home care Services in Buckinghamshire (\"the Services\"). The Council is conducting the procurement via the \"Light Touch Regime\" as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015). \r\nSuppliers will be expected to deliver Services for people assessed as being eligible for health or social care support under the provisions of The Care Act (2014) or The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care (2022). Additionally, Suppliers will support Individuals being discharged from hospital through the Home First pathway who are awaiting an assessment of need. The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

The Trust acknowledges that the current facilities are outdated and not compatible with expectations of service users or staff and they significantly hinder the Trust's ability to deliver modern and progressive models of care.\r\n      The survey and investigations have shown the whole roof of Rockingham Wing to be constructed of RAAC and there are a significant number of RAAC panels, which are in a critical condition in terms of failure.  The first floor has therefore been largely vacated and emergency propping has been carried out.\r\n      A short Option Appraisal was produced to compare the feasibility, cost and programmes for providing a resolution to the problem, which considers:\r\n      â¢A medium term (5-10 years) failsafe propping solution\r\n      â¢A newbuild extension to permanently vacate the first floor\r\n      The proposal is to develop this second option in terms of feasibility and deliverability of a traditional build solution.",

    "title": "Contracts Finder Notices - Dynamic Purchasing Vehicle (DPV) for the Provision of Home Care Services in Buckinghamshire",
    "description": "Buckinghamshire Council (the Council) is seeking to establish a Dynamic Purchasing Vehicle (\"DPV\") for the provision of home care Services in Buckinghamshire (\"the Services\"). The Council is conducting the procurement via the \"Light Touch Regime\" as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015). \r\nSuppliers will be expected to deliver Services for people assessed as being eligible for health or social care support under the provisions of The Care Act (2014) or The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care (2022). Additionally, Suppliers will support Individuals being discharged from hospital through the Home First pathway who are awaiting an assessment of need. The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

The provision is divided into two Lots by geography:\r\nLot a) Brighton and Hove \r\nLot b) West Sussex. \r\nProviders may submit a bid response to one or both lots. \r\nThe Commissioners will contract with a single legal entity for each Lot (one in Brighton and Hove and one in West Sussex), responsible for delivery of all required Mental Health Support Services in each area. Providers will decide and detail within their bid/s, how to structure themselves in order to ensure successful delivery of all required services. It is anticipated that organisations will join together to form business relationships in order to bid collectively as a single legal entity, for example, as a Lead Provider/Sub-Contractor model, a form of Alliance model with a Lead Member, a Consortium and so on.\r\n\r\nThe NHS Standard Contracts will be for a period of 5 years with an option (of the commissioner) to extend for a period of up to a further 24 months (5+2). The combined annual value across the two lots is Â£6,963,091.00, Â£34,815,455.00 over the 5 year duration and Â£48,741,637.00 should the full potential extension period be taken up. \r\nThe aim of the Mental Health Support Services (MHSS) is to improve the mental health and wellbeing of the adult population in Brighton and Hove and West Sussex.  \r\n \r\nThis is a Provider Selection Regime (PSR) Contract Notice, procured as a 'Mixed Procurement' through the Competitive Process, subject to the Health Care Services (Provider Selection Regime) Regulations 2023.

    "description": "NHS England (London Region) (hereafter referred to as \"the Authority\") is seeking to re-commission 5 Diabetic Eye Screening Programmes (DESP) to deliver screening to the eligible populations of North West London (Lot 1), North Central London (Lot 2), North East London (Lot 3), South East London (Lot 4), and South West London (Lot 5).\r\nThe eligible population includes patients over the age of 12 diagnosed with diabetes registered with, or eligible to be registered with, a GP in the lot area as well as individuals within prisons, secure units and the armed forces.\r\nThe aim of the DESP is to reduce the risk of sight loss amongst people with diabetes by the prompt identification and effective treatment, if necessary, of sight threatening diabetic retinopathy.\r\nThis will be achieved by delivering an evidence-based service that:\r\nâ¢Identifies the eligible population and ensures effective delivery with maximum coverage.\r\nâ¢Is safe, effective, high quality, externally and independently monitored, and quality assured.\r\nâ¢Leads to earlier detection, appropriate referral, effective treatment and improved outcomes.\r\nâ¢Is delivered and supported by suitably trained, competent and qualified clinical and non-clinical staff who, where relevant, participate in recognised ongoing continuing medical education, continuous professional development and quality assurance schemes.\r\nâ¢Has audit embedded in the service.\r\nâ¢Works effectively with other stakeholders to ensure the care pathway is smooth and efficient.\r\nThere are 3 key elements of service delivery, namely:\r\nâ¢Call/recall for all people with diabetes invited for routine digital screening; this is currently undertaken on an annual basis, but screening intervals are likely to extend to 2 years for people at low risk during the contract term, in line with national guidance.\r\nâ¢Digital surveillance where individuals need more frequent screening.\r\nâ¢Slit lamp bio-microscopy (SLB) for those individuals where normal photography is inappropriate (e.g. those having cataracts). \r\nOptical Coherence Tomography (OCT) does not form part of this Contract at this time, though this position may change over the life of the contract in line with national guidance. \r\nThe Contract term will be 5 years, with an option to extend for a further 2 years at the sole discretion of the Commissioner. The Contracts are due to commence on 01/07/2024.\r\nThe 7-year estimated contract values, based on predicted activity levels, are:\r\nLot 1 = Â£33,703,069, Lot 2 = Â£18,930,476, Lot 3 = Â£28,062,012, Lot 4 = Â£21,533,552, Lot 5 = Â£18,120,336 \r\n\r\nPlease note, the full indicative contract values per each financial year can be found in the tender documentation.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: NHS England proposes an activity-based financial model with the following tariffs: \r\nâ¢\tRoutine digital screening (RS001) - Â£39.10 per screen.\r\nâ¢\tSlit lamp bio-microscopy (SLB003) - Â£48.29 per screen.\r\nâ¢\tDigital surveillance (DS002) - Â£39.10 per screen.\r\nâ¢\tPrisons screening (PS004) - Â£78.21 per screen.\r\nâ¢\tForensics screening (FS005) - Â£58.65 per screen.\r\nThe Commissioner's ambition through the financial model is to encourage uptake of DESP to achieve or exceed the national achievable target of 85% uptake in routine screening (DE1).\r\nThe Services will be commissioned using the NHS DESP National Service Specification 23-24, localised where appropriate.\r\nNational changes to screening frequency for low-risk individuals are expected to be implemented during the contract term which will have an impact on activity. The subsequent impact on contract values will be agreed between the Provider and the Commissioner via contract variation. Activity projections used in this procurement do not account for these future changes as further clarity around timeline and implementation guidance is expected in the future. Further information is provided in the tender documentation.\r\nInterested providers may bid for one, multiple or all lots. However, if successful across multiple lots following evaluation, bidders will be awarded no more than two lots.\r\nThe Procurement is being managed by the NHS London Commercial Hub (NHS LCH) hosted by NEL ICB, on behalf of the Authority, in connection with a competitive Invitation to Tender (ITT) exercise that is being conducted via a process, based in part on the open procedure under the Public Contract Regulations 2015 (\"the Regulations\" (as amended)). \r\nThe Service falls within the scope of the Light Touch Regime (LTR) - Section 7 (Reg 74-76) of the Regulations governing procurement of Health, Social and related services listed under Schedule 3 of the Regulations. None of the references to \"Open procedure\", \"ITT\", the use of the term \"tender process\", or any other indication shall be taken to mean that the Authority intends to hold itself bound to any of the Regulations, save those applicable to LTR provisions.\r\nThe tendering process will be conducted in accordance with the requirements and flexibilities provided by Articles 74 to 76 of the Directive, and Regulations 74 to 76 of the Regulations. The Authority will run a transparent tender process, treating all Bidders equally. For the avoidance of doubt, the Authority will not be bound by the Regulations or the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union or any other regulations or legislation except for the specific parts or circumstances that apply to the procurement of these Services.\r\nThe Contracting Authority intends to voluntarily observe the award decision notices provisions and 10-day standstill period described in Regulation 86 of the Regulations.",

    "title": "Quantum Technology Missions Roadmap Opportunity",
    "description": "Introduction and summary of requirements \r\n\r\nWe would like individuals or organisations with commercial and technical knowledge of the quantum technology sector to develop detailed road maps to support the design and delivery of the National Quantum Strategy Missions.  \r\n\r\nThe focus of each road map will vary based on the characteristics of each Mission, as well as current evidence gaps that need addressing to inform policy development. The breadth and depth of specialist expertise required to deliver the road maps is substantial, spanning technical milestones for quantum entanglement networks to the identification of clinical use cases for quantum sensors. This opportunity has therefore been broken down into four separate lots to allow individuals or organisations with specific expertise relevant to individual Missions to participate.  \r\n\r\nAims and Objectives \r\n\r\nThis project will gather evidence to help DSIT understand the key commercial opportunities, technology requirements and milestones, and dependencies for each Mission. This evidence will inform ongoing policy development and help shape policy interventions such as technology-specific innovation programmes, infrastructure investments and market creation activity to support overall Mission delivery.  \r\n\r\nAlongside common evidence requirements for all lots (technology development timelines and underpinning requirements for priority use cases), there are specific requirements for each. These are outlined below:\r\n\r\nLot A: Quantum networking (Mission 2): technology and research milestones to materialise quantum networks, analysis of competing quantum networking components, underpinning classical infrastructure requirements\r\n\r\nLot B: Quantum sensing for healthcare (Mission 3): high potential clinical use case identification, mapping of necessary activity through the NHS HealthTech adoption framework\r\n\r\nLot C: Quantum position, navigation and timing (PNT) (Mission 4): market size estimates for core sub-component technologies such as compound semiconductors, MEMS vacuum cells, integrated photonics and advanced packaging.\r\n\r\nLot D: Quantum sensing for critical national infrastructure (CNI) (Mission 5): Current and future performance of sensing platforms, market size estimates for use cases such as gravity sensing in different sectors\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nThe ITT can be found on DSIT&apos;s e-procurement portal, Jaggaer, under live opportunities.\r\n\r\nhttps://beisgroup.ukp.app.jaggaer.com/",

    "description": "The purpose of this PIN is to inform prospective research and/or academic organisations of an opportunity to develop and carry out a research evaluation on a scenario based modular cyber security exercise. On behalf of NHSE, HI NENC wishes to engage a research and/or academic organisation with proven experience in developing gaming software to create two ALPHA scenario models. We are seeking two cyber security ALPHA products with scope to develop future modules. We also require research and evaluation of the effectiveness of the products to be provided. Primarily the users are defined as senior leaders within adult social care organisations.\r\nThe current prevalence of cyber-attacks and especially ransomware attacks is significantly increasing business risk across the health and care sector. Due to a range of structural, financial and operational challenges the digital maturity and resilience of social care organisations is variable. Humans are the primary attack targets of organisations and this product seeks to improve their preparedness by defending as one.\r\nHealth data is a valuable commodity and these modules will endeavour to safeguard it. The gamification provides an accessible learning experience in a complex and stressful space. This will be achieved through engaging across the spectrum of learning types (visual, read/write, auditory and kinaesthetic learning with particular emphasis on the later).\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nHI NENC would like to invite potential providers of these services to apply to our Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) DN670401 as a supplier.\r\nYou can do this by following this link: procontract.due-north.com/ProjectManagement/ProjectDashboard?projectId=c1881153-e6f3-ed11-8122-005056b64545\r\nThis opportunity will be developed as a further competition under Lots 3 and 5 of our DPS. You should therefore ensure you apply to either Lot 3 or 5 depending on your company core business to be able to bid to provide this service.\r\nYou are also welcome to apply for any other Lots on our DPS that you feel are relevant to your organisation.\r\nIf your company is not registered with the Proactis (ProContract) Due North Portal, click on this link Supplier registration (due-north.com) and complete your organisation name and email address and continue your registration.\r\nWe are expecting to put out the Invitation to Quote to our Lot 3 and 5 suppliers at the beginning of January 2025. This timeline is subject to change. Interested suppliers are advised to apply to the DPS promptly to ensure they have been accepted to the framework and receive the competition notification. Please note that HI NENC are closed from Close of Play 20 December 2024 until 3 January 2025.\r\nThis notice is for information and engaging with the supply market only. It is not a binding statement of intent or call for competition. HI NENC reserves the right not to enter a formal process and not award a contract. The information contained in this notice, including information relating to the nature and scope of the requirements, the service classification of this requirement from the list of CPV codes, is only indicative of the HI NENC's current thinking and is neither exhaustive nor binding.

    "description": "Cumberland Council is advertising an Open Framework for providers to deliver Homecare Services, for the delivery of personal care tasks in people's own homes on a 24/7 basis for people over 18.  These services are regulated by the Care Quality Commission under The Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, on a 24/7 basis for people over 18.  There are two lots - Lot 1 - Standard Homecare Services / Lot 2 - Bespoke / Non Standard Homecare Services.  \\\\r\\r\r\n\\\\r\\r\r\nThe Council proposes to enter in to the Framework Agreement for an initial period of 48 months with the successful providers. There are TWO optional extensions available of up to 12 months each. The maximum length of the Framework Agreement, including the optional extensions is 72 months. These optional extensions are at the complete discretion of the Council. The end date of 31st March 2030 includes the two optional extensions. If these extensions are not used, the Framework will end on 31st March 2028. \\\\r\\r\r\n\\\\r\\r\r\nIn addition to Cumberland Council (the contracting authority), the NHS North East and North Cumbria Integrated Care Board (the ICB) is a potential user of this Framework and they may purchase homecare services, subject to the ICB signing a Framework Access Agreement. \\\\r\\r\r\n\\\\r\\r\r\nThe estimated total value of the Framework for the 4-year initial term is Â£128.144m excluding VAT.  The estimated total value for the initial term plus the two 12 months optional extensions is Â£213.038m excluding VAT. These estimated totals are based upon the maximum spend by Cumberland Council and the ICB accessing the Framework from Day 1. The Cumberland Council potential spend on Homecare Services over the full 6-year term is estimated to be Â£133.882m. Details of current expenditure are indicative only. The Council does not guarantee any spend against this Framework Agreement. \\\\r\\r\r\n\\\\r\\r\r\nYou must be registered on The Chest (https://www.the-chest.org.uk/) to access the tender documents.

    "description": "Buckinghamshire Council (the Council) is seeking to establish a Dynamic Purchasing Vehicle (\"DPV\") for the provision of home care Services in Buckinghamshire (\"the Services\"). The Council is conducting the procurement via the \"Light Touch Regime\" as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015). \r\nSuppliers will be expected to deliver Services for people assessed as being eligible for health or social care support under the provisions of The Care Act (2014) or The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care (2022). Additionally, Suppliers will support Individuals being discharged from hospital through the Home First pathway who are awaiting an assessment of need. The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

The purpose of this RFI is to gauge market interest and gain feedback via the RFI response form.\r\nPlease note that this is not a procurement exercise but a means of collecting information from the market to help us inform the Statement of Requirements/Specification for any future procurement opportunity.\r\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends (NG12) urgent abdominal imaging for people who are aged 60 and over with new-onset diabetes (NOD) and weight loss. Evidence suggests currently only 3.5% of people who meet these criteria are being referred for an ultrasound or CT scan within 30 days. \r\n There is an intention to run a pilot with the aim to improve the implementation of NG12 by searching patient GP records to identify people aged 60 and over with new-onset diabetes (NOD) and weight loss and invite them for a series of tests to check for early signs of pancreatic cancer. Case finding is expected to lead to a 2.6% - 4.7% impact on pancreatic cancer staging. If this pilot is effective, it could have a significant impact on diagnosis and thus survivability of pancreatic cancer in the future. If diagnosed early (stages 1-2) patients have a greater chance or receiving curative treatment.\r\n\r\nTo participate in the Request for Information and access the RFI document please go to https://health-family.force.com/s/Welcome",

    "description": "This notice is placed in order to facilitate early engagement with potential providers, and relates only to a pre-procurement market briefing.\r\n\r\nNHS Hampshire and Isle of Wight (HIOW) Integrated Care Board (ICB) are seeking to commission Mandatory Dental Services (MDS) on the Isle of Wight, and will be holding a procurement process to award new contracts for service commencement from April 2025.\r\n\r\nProspective bidders are warmly invited to a pre-procurement market briefing event held virtually through Microsoft Teams on the following date:\r\n\r\n5pm - 7pm Friday 8th November 2024 by MS Teams\r\n\r\nThe event has been arranged to take place to avoid any clash with clinical sessions and will be hosted online.\r\n\r\nThe procurement(s) are anticipated to commence from early November 2024, inviting tenders to deliver services for specific lotted areas, with phased contract commencement anticipated in the period from April to September 2025. \r\n\r\nThe procurement is anticipated to be split into a number of Lots as follows:-\r\n\r\nLot 5C1-1: Isle of Wight (21k)\r\nLot 5C1-2: Isle of Wight (14k)\r\nLot 5C1-3: West Wight\r\n\r\n\r\nA maximum of one contract will be awardable in each Lot, except in the case of Lot 5C1-1, where a maximum of 2 contracts will be awardable.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners anticipate contracting for services under PDS agreements for a period of up to 10 years. This procurement is being carried out by NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of the Commissioner.\r\n\r\nTo allow potential providers to reflect on the proposed services, the Commissioner has provided early indicative information as part of this notice.\r\n\r\nAt the briefing, we will share further detail of the commissioner's objectives, the proposed specification for the service, lotting intentions and pricing strategy. We will also provide details of the e-Procurement system (being used to procure these services) and how the procurement and selection process will operate.\r\n\r\nTo access the information suite and express an interest, interested providers should register on the e-procurement system, Atamis, available on the following link: https://health-family.force.com/s/Welcome and express interest via the 'Live Opportunities' list.\r\n\r\nPlease note that you will need to be registered on Atamis and select the option to 'register an interest' under the project Market Briefing: Mandatory Dental Services (MDS) on the Isle of Wight, followed by completing and submitting the Market Briefing Event Registration form.\r\n\r\nIn order to attend the Market Briefing Event, please ensure that you submit the registration form via Atamis by no later than 12 Noon on Wednesday 6th November 2024, including your contact details as requested. Details on how to access the briefing will be provided to all responses received prior to this closing date.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: The briefing event is open to all providers who may want to deliver NHS mandatory dental services in the future. In order to establish fair representation, availability for this event is limited to a maximum of two individuals per organisation.\r\n\r\nLots:\r\n5C1-1 Isle of Wight (21k)\r\nA maximum of 2 contracts will be awardable in this Lot, each for total UDA activity of 21,000 UDAs.\r\n\r\n5C1-2 Isle of Wight (14k)\r\nA maximum of 1 contract will be awardable in this Lot, for total UDA activity of 14,000 UDAs.\r\n\r\n5C1-3 West Wight\r\nA maximum of 1 contract will be awardable in this Lot, for total UDA activity of 12,000 UDAs.\r\n\r\nProviders are reminded that the information documents provided in Atamis are indicative draft versions only and subject to change.

    "description": "Buckinghamshire Council (the Council) is seeking to establish a Dynamic Purchasing Vehicle (\"DPV\") for the provision of home care Services in Buckinghamshire (\"the Services\"). The Council is conducting the procurement via the \"Light Touch Regime\" as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015). \r\nSuppliers will be expected to deliver Services for people assessed as being eligible for health or social care support under the provisions of The Care Act (2014) or The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care (2022). Additionally, Suppliers will support Individuals being discharged from hospital through the Home First pathway who are awaiting an assessment of need. The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

Services are planned to commence from 1st April 2025.\r\n\r\nThe eligible population includes patients over the age of 12 diagnosed with diabetes and registered with, or eligible to be registered with a GP, as well as individuals within prisons, secure units, and the armed forces.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the Diabetic Eye Screening Programme is to reduce the risk of sight loss amongst people with diabetes by the prompt identification and effective treatment, if necessary, of sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy.\r\n\r\nThis should be achieved by delivering an evidence-based service that:\r\nâ¢ focuses on improving uptake, reducing inequalities, and improving outcomes\r\nâ¢ is accessible across all service elements\r\nâ¢ is engaging, and integrated, working effectively with service users and stakeholders to ensure seamless and high-quality care\r\nâ¢ is safe, effective, and high quality, with robust processes along the pathway\r\nâ¢ embed a culture of quality, improvement, and learning\r\nâ¢ is well-led, managed, and staffed\r\n\r\nThere are three key elements of service delivery, namely:\r\nâ¢ routine digital screening - from 2025 and 2026, all eligible patients are to be managed on 12- or 24-month intervals\r\nâ¢ Digital surveillance where more frequent screening of those individuals who may be at increased risk of developing diabetic retinopathy but have not reached the threshold to be referred into the Hospital Eye Services (HES), as required\r\nâ¢ Slit lamp bio-microscopy (SLB) for those individuals where normal photography is inappropriate (e.g., those having cataracts)\r\n\r\nOptical Coherence Tomography (OCT) will be introduced into the programme across England in line with national guidance.\r\n\r\nThe total contract values for the 5 year initial term were advertised as follows:\r\n\r\nLot 1: Kent and Medway - Â£17,755,303\r\nLot 2: Surrey Heartlands - Â£8,084,825\r\nLot 3: Hampshire and IOW - Â£16,695,800\r\nLot 4: Berkshire and Frimley - Â£11,311,121\r\nLot 5: Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire - Â£9,927,015\r\n\r\nThis notice serves as an intention to award a contract under the competitive process of the Provider Selection Regime (PSR).\r\n\r\nThis procurement has been carried out by NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of the Commissioners.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: The decision to award this contract in line with the Competitive Process was based on evaluation against the basic selection criteria (in the form of a Selection Questionnaire), which was assessed on a pass/fail basis, the PSR 5 key criteria, plus staffing and mobilisation, which were assessed on a 0-4 scale, with the below weightings. \r\n\r\nSeveral tender questions were asked under each of the key criteria.\r\n-\tQuality and Innovation: 38%\r\n-\tValue: 5%\r\n-\tIntegration, Collaboration and Service Sustainability: 19%\r\n-\tImproving Access, Reducing Health Inequalities, and Facilitating Choice: 15%\r\n-\tSocial Value: 13%\r\n-\tStaffing and mobiliation: 10%\r\n\r\nThe provider(s) selected for award have been chosen as they passed the basic selection criteria and were the highest scoring bidder overall, against the key criteria. \r\n\r\nAfter conducting a thorough Competitive Process, taking into account the key criteria and applying the basic selection criteria, NHS England South East is content that the provider's bids sufficiently met the key criteria and thus can proceed to contract award under the Health Care Services (Provider Selection Regime) Regulations 2023.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation panel consisted of representatives from NHS England South East, including Commissioning, Screening & Immunisations, Finance, Human Resources, and Nursing & Quality.  \r\n\r\nAward decisions have been recommended by the Head of Public Health Commissioning for Hampshire & Thames Valley (NHSE SE), and the Senior Public Health Commissioning Manager (NHSE SE).\r\n\r\nAward decisions have been made by key members of the South East Regional Executive Team (SERET), namely, the South East Regional Director (also Chair) and the Regional Director of Commissioning for the South East. \r\n\r\nThere were two potential declarations of conflict of interest made via the conflict of interest process and recorded accordingly; these were not decision makers. Conflicts were appropriately managed, with one personnel being removed from the process.

    "description": "Buckinghamshire Council (the Council) is seeking to establish a Dynamic Purchasing Vehicle (\"DPV\") for the provision of home care Services in Buckinghamshire (\"the Services\"). The Council is conducting the procurement via the \"Light Touch Regime\" as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015). \r\nSuppliers will be expected to deliver Services for people assessed as being eligible for health or social care support under the provisions of The Care Act (2014) or The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care (2022). Additionally, Suppliers will support Individuals being discharged from hospital through the Home First pathway who are awaiting an assessment of need. The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out.\r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website:\r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk\r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation.\r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).\r\n",

    "description": "The NHS is facing a period of intense pressure to reduce waiting lists. Trusts are looking towards innovative solutions to help reduce their referral to treatment times and increase efficiency through better utilisation of their existing facilities.\r\n\r\nNHS Trusts may find it difficult to meet referral to treatment (RTT) targets due to lack of capacity. Locum staff can fill gaps but Trusts still need to manage the patient pathway which may not be possible outside normal hours (e.g. evenings & weekends). On-site Surgical and Medical Capacity Solutions (sometime known as \"Insourcing\") will act in a complementary way to partially or totally manage the Pathway for referred Patients. \r\n\r\nThis Framework Agreement will facilitate maximisation of in-house capacity to a level that the Participating Authorities can reduce the need for additional mobile facilities and outsourcing. At the same time, in-patient and out-patient waiting times will be reduced, referrals will be expedited, service quality will be improved and patient satisfaction will be positively impacted. \r\n\r\nThe Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust's Commercial Procurement Service seeks to introduce a new, flexible commercial Framework Agreement which will allow UK public bodies to procure on-site surgical and medical capacity solutions. This will enable Participating Authorities to act quickly in realising efficiencies.\r\n\r\nThe services in scope of this procurement process are healthcare services which fall under 'social and other specific services' in Section 7 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 ('PCR') (as amended). In accordance with Regulation 76 PCR, the process is to set up a framework agreement and will follow a procedure similar to the open procedure. However, the Framework Manager and the contracting authorities using the framework are only bound by the parts of the PCR that specifically apply to social and other specific services. \r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the rules that apply to the open procedure under Regulation 27 and framework agreements under Regulation 33 do not apply to this procurement. All providers that meet the minimum requirements set out under the procurement process will be appointed to the framework agreement. There will be no maximum number of providers appointed.\r\n\r\nThe Framework will be re-opened to new applicants annually, approximately 90 days before the anniversary of the Framework Commencement Date. Previously appointed Suppliers will NOT be obliged to re-apply on an annual basis. Framework Suppliers appointed on the first anniversary of the Framework Commencement Date will be awarded a Framework Agreement of up to 3 years duration; Framework Suppliers appointed on the second anniversary of the Framework Commencement Date will be awarded a Framework Agreement of up to 2 years duration and Framework Suppliers appointed on the third anniversary of the Framework Commencement Date will be awarded a Framework Agreement of up to 1 year duration.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nEligible users of the flexible framework can be viewed free of charge at https://www.coch-cps.co.uk/",

    "title": "Prior Information Notice for Device Repurposing",
    "description": "This notice is to inform suppliers of a potential project to repurpose used phones, laptops, tablet computers and the like. Health Innovation North East North Cumbria (HI NENC) is supporting the NENC Integrated Care Board. The specific aim is to seek support with taking ex-NHS and ex-local government devices so that they can be given to those who need them most for their health needs. This is part of a project that started with an engagement event in the summer to talk about how the service could be set up.\r\n\r\nWe often need to be online to access healthcare, but not everyone has access to what they need. To be \"digitally included\", a person needs four things:\r\n\r\nDevices: Good, working devices that are right for the tasks.\r\nConnectivity: Good access to cheap internet or data to get online.\r\nSkills: Knowing confidently how to safely use digital tools.\r\nAccessibility: Easily find information and services online.\r\n\r\nThis programme supports patients who may not have these tools, and the goal is to make sure they are able to have all they need to be digitally included. We want to find suppliers that can support by collecting unused devices from the NHS and partners across the region and check to see if the devices are safe for re-purposing. Suppliers will need to sanitise the devices in accordance with regulations and standards before they are provided to patients. If the devices are not suitable then the suppliers will need to correctly dispose of them. \r\n\r\nSuppliers would need to comply fully with all current and forthcoming legislation and regulations related to the packaging, handling, transportation, processing, and disposal of ICT equipment containing personal and sensitive information. They would be expected to already hold appropriate certification, permissions and authorisations to be able to handle the work anticipated above. This could include but is not limited to being approved by CPNI or NPSA (MS) and have a staff vetting process (eg. BPSS/DBS/ SC/DV/NPPV).\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nHI NENC would like to invite potential providers of these services to apply to our Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) DN670401 as a supplier.\r\n\r\nYou can do this by following this link: procontract.due-north.com/ProjectManagement/ProjectDashboard?projectId=c1881153-e6f3-ed11-8122-005056b64545\r\n\r\nThis opportunity will be developed as a further competition under Lot 5 of our DPS. You should therefore ensure you apply to Lot 5 to be able to bid to provide this service.\r\n\r\nYou are also welcome to apply for any other Lots on our DPS that you feel are relevant to your organisation.\r\nIf your company is not registered with the Proactis (ProContract) Due North Portal, click on this link Supplier registration (due-north.com) and complete your organisation name and email address and continue your registration.\r\n\r\nWe are expecting to put out the Invitation to Quote to our Lot 5 suppliers in early 2025. This timeline is subject to change. Interested suppliers are advised to apply to the DPS promptly to ensure they have been accepted to the framework and receive the competition notification.\r\n\r\nThis notice is for information and engaging with the supply market only. It is not a binding statement of intent or call for competition. HI NENC reserves the right not to enter a formal process and not award a contract. The information contained in this notice, including information relating to the nature and scope of the requirements, the service classification of this requirement from the list of CPV codes, is only indicative of the HI NENC's current thinking and is neither exhaustive nor binding. HI NENC reserves the right at its absolute discretion to amend it at the time of issue of any further notices or at any other time.\r\n\r\nHI NENC will not be liable for any bid cost, expenditure, work or effort incurred by a potential supplier in acting on the basis of this PIN.",

    "description": "Buckinghamshire Council (the Council) is seeking to establish a Dynamic Purchasing Vehicle (\"DPV\") for the provision of home care Services in Buckinghamshire (\"the Services\"). The Council is conducting the procurement via the \"Light Touch Regime\" as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015). \r\nSuppliers will be expected to deliver Services for people assessed as being eligible for health or social care support under the provisions of The Care Act (2014) or The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care (2022). Additionally, Suppliers will support Individuals being discharged from hospital through the Home First pathway who are awaiting an assessment of need. The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

This contract has been awarded under the Health Care Services (Provider Selection Regime) Regulations 2023. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 do not apply to this award. This contract has now been formally awarded using the competitive process.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: The decision to award this contract in line with the Competitive Process was based on evaluation against the basic selection criteria (in the form of a Selection Questionnaire), which was assessed on a pass/fail basis, and the PSR 5 key criteria, which were assessed on a 0-4 scale, with the below weightings. \r\n\r\nSeveral tender questions were asked under each of the key criteria.\r\n-\tQuality and Innovation: 46%\r\n-\tValue: 10%\r\n-\tIntegration, Collaboration and Service Sustainability: 17%\r\n-\tImproving Access, Reducing Health Inequalities, and Facilitating \r\n        Choice: 17%\r\n-\tSocial Value: 10%\r\n\r\nThe providers selected for award have been chosen as they passed the basic selection criteria and were the highest scoring bidder overall, against the key criteria. \r\n\r\nAfter conducting a thorough Competitive Process, taking into account the key criteria and applying the basic selection criteria, NHS England South East is content that the providers' bids sufficiently met the key criteria and thus can proceed to contract award under the Health Care Services (Provider Selection Regime) Regulations 2023.\r\n\r\nThe evaluation panel consisted of representatives from NHS England Health & Justice Commissioners, NHSE Finance, NHSE Nursing and Quality, NHSE Public health, Offices of the Police and Crime Commissioner, Probation Service and those with Lived Experience.  \r\n\r\nAward decisions have been recommended by the NHS England South West Health & Justice Senior Commissioning Manager for Non-Custodial and Children and Young People services. \r\nAward decisions have been made by the NHS England South West System Oversight and Co-ordination Leadership Team, with key decision makers being: \r\n\r\nManaging Director - System Commissioning Development\r\nDirector of Collaborative Commissioning\r\nDirector of Commissioning Finance\r\n\r\nThere were four potential declarations of conflict of interest made via the conflict of interest process and recorded accordingly. However, none were deemed as actual conflicts. One potential / perceived conflict, whilst deemed as no risk to the procurement by the Programme Board Chair, was managed accordingly with appropriate mitigations. \r\n\r\nThe awarding of this contract is subject to the Health Care Services (Provider Selection Regime) Regulations 2023. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 do not apply to this award. The publication of this notice marks the start of the standstill period. Representations by providers must be made to the relevant authority by midnight on Wednesday 16th October 2024. This contract has not yet formally been awarded; this notice serves as an intention to award a contract under the competitive process of the PSR.\r\n\r\nThis procurement has been carried out by NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of the Commissioners.",

    "description": "The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care acting through the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is seeking to appoint suppliers to a multi-lot open framework agreement. The proposed agreement, UKHSA Diagnostics and Research Framework, will source supplies and services for diagnostics and research activities. The term of the proposed open framework will be 8 years. The open framework shall be reopened to new suppliers at least twice within the 8 years.\r\n \r\nThe UKHSA Diagnostics and Research Framework will include, but not be limited to, the supply of diagnostics goods or services for the qualitative/quantitative examination of specimens/samples and the supply of research use only goods or services for the qualitative/quantitative examination of specimens/samples. \r\n \r\nThis open framework will be used to support UKHSA core functions and provide access partners with a route to source diagnostics and research equipment, consumables and services. The intention of this framework is to complement other frameworks in this space, such as the NHS Supply Chains Laboratory Diagnostics, Point of Care Testing and Pathology Managed Services Framework.\r\n\r\nEstimated cost excluding VAT Â£5,000,000,000\r\n\r\nLot 1\r\nDiagnostics\r\nUKCA/CE Marked and MHRA approved Diagnostics equipment, consumables and maintenance supplies and related services\r\n\r\nLot 2\r\nResearch and Development\r\nEquipment, maintenance, consumables, products and services for the purpose of research, experimentation, study or development.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nAdditional Information\r\nUK Health Security Agency as the contracting authority is putting in place an open framework for diagnostics and research equipment, consumables and related services. \r\nThis framework will be used to support UKHSA core functions across its diagnostics and research activities. For more information see UKHSA 10 year science strategy - \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ukhsa-science-strategy-2023-to-2033-securing-health-and-prosperity\r\n\r\nThe framework is intended to be accessed by UK Public Sector bodies including UKHSA, the Department of Health and Social Care, Public Health Wales, Public Health Scotland, NHS Authorities and Trusts, Special Health Authorities, Local Authorities and any other NHS entity or successor body. (A complete list of NHS Authorities and Trusts and special health authorities can be found here: https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/nhs-provider-directory/ ). The framework can also be accessed by academic and charitable institutions. \r\nThe framework value range is an estimate only and the values may vary dependent on the requirements of UKHSA and the other authorities who may choose to participate and purchase supplies and services over the life of the framework agreement. The framework value range of Â£5,000,000,000 GBP is an approximate estimate only.\r\nThe actual values will be to such level as those purchasing under the Open Framework consider necessary to provide suitable requirements. UKHSA works with DHSC and the NHS in its role as a national and international emergency responder to current and emerging threats to public health. As demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the exact nature, timing and escalation of such threats (and the corresponding required responses) can be difficult to foresee, making any exercise in future value estimation unpredictable.\r\nThe date listed as the \"estimated date of publication of contract notice\" is the date that UKHSA believes it will be able to start the tendering process. This date may be subject to change following feedback from suppliers regarding when they believe the market is in a position for a tender to submit tenders.\r\n\r\nUKHSA welcomes expressions of interest from SMEs and niche suppliers.\r\n\r\nAll interested suppliers are required to register on the UKHSA eTendering Portal. All communications from suppliers must be sent through this platform. All information on future engagement events will be provided through this portal.\r\nhttps://atamis-1928.my.site.com/s/Welcome\r\n\r\nAdditionally, following the commencement of the Procurement Act 2023, all suppliers shall need to join the Central Digital Platform. The anticipated onboarding process shall begin from late January 2025.\r\nPlease see the communications for the new platform below.\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/procurement-act-2023-short-guides/central-digital-platform-factsheet-html",

    "description": "Buckinghamshire Council (the Council) is seeking to establish a Dynamic Purchasing Vehicle (\"DPV\") for the provision of home care Services in Buckinghamshire (\"the Services\"). The Council is conducting the procurement via the \"Light Touch Regime\" as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015). \r\nSuppliers will be expected to deliver Services for people assessed as being eligible for health or social care support under the provisions of The Care Act (2014) or The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care (2022). Additionally, Suppliers will support Individuals being discharged from hospital through the Home First pathway who are awaiting an assessment of need. The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

    "description": "NHS SEL ICB, hereafter referred to as 'Authority' wishes to commission and identify voluntary sector organisations to engage in this large-scale school engagement initiative. Addressing inequalities in mental healthcare for children and young people across South East London is a priority area of focus for the ICB - to this end, the ICB is partnering with Black Thrive to address mental health inequalities for Black and mixed heritage school aged children, and looking for addition local voluntary sector organisations to engage in community engagement. \r\nBased on review of stakeholder feedback and data, the ICB recommended that there is a need to develop and enhance access to trauma-informed, early intervention and prevention wellbeing and mental health support for Black and mixed heritage children.  This is in recognition that Black and mixed heritage children have lower rates of referrals to child and adolescent mental health services but higher rates of school suspension/exclusion and detention under the mental health act. This project aims to engage with communities to develop collective solutions by coproducing anti-racist and trauma-informed initiatives. This programme will start in Feb 2025 and last for an initial 18-month period. Black Thrive would work in partnership with any successfully identified organisation, providing advice/guidance on roll out of the programme, delivering training and supervision to any staff working on the programme, and supporting networking and partnership working with other voluntary sector organizations and commissioners for South East London. The VCSE organisation would:   \r\n1.\tNeed to represent Black and mixed heritage communities. Ideal voluntary sector partners would have experience include engaging with Black and mixed heritage children, young people, and their families. This may include those who have experienced trauma, racism, discrimination, marginalisation, and which may include addressing mental health/wellbeing needs and/or support avoidance of harm. From March 2025 onwards, build positive and productive relationships with 6 primary schools within the borough to enable (1) mapping of existing offers / baseline understanding of need/challenges (2) collectively agreed solutions.\r\n\r\nThe Contract will commence on 03/02/2025 for an initial period of 18 Months.

    "description": "Buckinghamshire Council (the Council) is seeking to establish a Dynamic Purchasing Vehicle (\"DPV\") for the provision of home care Services in Buckinghamshire (\"the Services\"). The Council is conducting the procurement via the \"Light Touch Regime\" as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015). \r\nSuppliers will be expected to deliver Services for people assessed as being eligible for health or social care support under the provisions of The Care Act (2014) or The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care (2022). Additionally, Suppliers will support Individuals being discharged from hospital through the Home First pathway who are awaiting an assessment of need. The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

To support this requirement, a fleet of vehicles is available for use currently. \r\nSCW are looking for a delivery partner capable of providing lease vans up to a maximum fleet of 30 vehicles. \r\n\r\nThe Contractual model will be based on a call off arrangement, with up to a maximum of 30 vehicles being leased over the contract period at any one time.

    "description": "Buckinghamshire Council (the Council) is seeking to establish a Dynamic Purchasing Vehicle (\"DPV\") for the provision of home care Services in Buckinghamshire (\"the Services\"). The Council is conducting the procurement via the \"Light Touch Regime\" as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015). \r\nSuppliers will be expected to deliver Services for people assessed as being eligible for health or social care support under the provisions of The Care Act (2014) or The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care (2022). Additionally, Suppliers will support Individuals being discharged from hospital through the Home First pathway who are awaiting an assessment of need. The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

The total estimated value stated includes the option period.\r\n\r\nAs part of the on-going contract management process, during the period of the Framework Agreement, ESPO shall monitor the financial stability of the awarded Suppliers during the period of the Framework Agreement by reference to credit rating agency reports. ESPO shall obtain a credit score for the Supplier on or before the Framework start date as a base score and where a significant change in the credit score is identified over the life of the Framework Agreement, ESPO reserves the right to investigate the reasons for this significant change.

    "description": "Buckinghamshire Council (the Council) is seeking to establish a Dynamic Purchasing Vehicle (\"DPV\") for the provision of home care Services in Buckinghamshire (\"the Services\"). The Council is conducting the procurement via the \"Light Touch Regime\" as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015). \r\nSuppliers will be expected to deliver Services for people assessed as being eligible for health or social care support under the provisions of The Care Act (2014) or The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care (2022). Additionally, Suppliers will support Individuals being discharged from hospital through the Home First pathway who are awaiting an assessment of need. The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\"). \r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways. \r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered. \r\nThe Lots are: \r\nLot 1: Standard home care \r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care \r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business. \r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied. \r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot. \r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out. \r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website: \r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk \r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation. \r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

The contract period is for a total of 24 months, from the 16th April 2025 - 15th April 2027, with a maximum total aggregate contract value of Â£200,000 (inclusive VAT).\r\n\r\nThis notice is being published to reflect the date by which the Authority has satisfied it&apos;s internal governance process and the Authority&apos;s signatures have been ascertained, not at the time of the proposed start-date of this contract. The Service to which this procurement relates fall within the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 as amended by as amended by The Public Procurement (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, (the \"Regulations\").\r\n\r\nThis is a Contract Award Notice to communicate the contract awarded by the Authority to Quantum IT for the provision of a CPMS. Across the system there are inconsistent processes for the management of non-medical practice placements (nursing, midwifery and AHP&apos;s), resulting in lack of organisational and system oversight of placement utilisation, learner numbers and student tariff. To ensure MSE ICS can work towards the CLE Strategy and Long-Term Workforce Plan a systematic approach needs to occur. The Authority aims to move to a system wide Centralised Placement Management System (CPMS), that would hold and manage all non-medical learner data, whilst effectively co-ordinating and managing placement processes. Each organisation would continue to manage and hold responsibility for their own placements and utilisation of the database, yet the system wide overview will ensure effective wider collaboration of placement utilisation and recruitment could occur. Without collaboration, organisations will continue to work in silo, with an increased risk of lack of oversight of learners across individual organisations. The Authority identified value for money with more than 5% savings from the direct award of this contract that would have been enacted from the framework agreement fees.\r\n\r\nThe Authority is publishing this Contract Award Notice in both the Find a Tender platform and Contracts Finder in accordance with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (as amended by The Public Procurement (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020) for spend above Â£30,000.00\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nThis notice is being published to reflect the date by which the Authority has satisfied it&apos;s internal governance process and the Authority&apos;s signatures have been ascertained, not at the time of the proposed start-date of this contract.

Inpatient / day case admissions would also require primary and secondary diagnosis codes, along with any procedures undertaken.\r\nDue to the complexity of clinical coding and range of clinical documentation which would need to be reviewed, along with associated standards / rules, it is likely that early results would be achieved with less complex day cases or within an area such as Endoscopy.\r\nWe will work with the suppliers to provide access to clinical records and documentation and provide clinical coding advice, testing and validation of any outputs.\r\nThe initial outputs will need to be tested against coded records to ensure accuracy and depth of coding, to ensure there is no impact on reported clinical outcomes or finances.\r\nAs part of any agreed contract data protection and data security requirements would need to be met.\r\n\r\nWe intend to run a further competition through the Countess of Chester Hospital Commercial Procurement Services Clinical Coding Support Services DPS (reference DPS012). Only those suppliers confirmed on the DPS will be considered for invitation to the further competition.\r\n\r\nPlease email info@coch-cps.co.uk to express interest in joining the above referenced DPS.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Any supplier must be registered on the DPS no later than 17:00 on Friday 21st February 2025.

    "description": "The framework provides a national solution that offers customers a range of grounds maintenance services including seasonal grass cutting, shrub maintenance, weeding, sports pitch marking, arboriculture services and winter grounds services such as gritting. The framework is split into two Lots:\r\n\r\nLot 1- Grounds Maintenance Services\r\nLot 2- Arboriculture Services\r\n\r\nThe framework agreement has the option to extend for up to a further 24 months. The total estimated value stated includes the option period.\r\n\r\nESPO shall monitor the financial stability of the awarded Suppliers during the period of the Framework Agreement by reference to credit ratings agency reports. ESPO shall obtain a credit score for the Supplier on or before the Framework start date as a base score and where a significant change in the credit score is identified over the life of the Framework Agreement, ESPO reserves the right to investigate the reasons for this significant change. Depending on the severity of the changes, it will be at the sole discretion of ESPO to suspend or even permanently remove the Supplier from the Framework Agreement.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal.\r\n\r\nESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.\r\n\r\nAny Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders information only.\r\n\r\nAn eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.",

It has a dispersed, mainly rural population of approximately 540 000 people, with only one in four of its residents living in one of its three largest towns; Taunton; Yeovil; and Bridgwater.\r\n\r\nSomerset has two acute trusts within its borders (Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust and Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust) as well as 13 community hospitals (run by Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust) and 75 GP practices.\r\nThe provision of Non-Emergency Patient Transport (NEPT) services for Somerset is delivered by different suppliers under contracts awarded through the Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) for use by Acute and Non Acute hospital Trusts, Community Hospitals and other non-acute care establishments and GP Practices within Somerset. Transport is provided depending on patient needs and eligibility for the NEPT service together with the supplier's capacity and availability to supply service.\r\nThe DPS will be available for use by all public sector bodies within Somerset, the CCG, Community Hospitals and other Care Providers and other organisations approved by the CCG. All call off contracts will be administered by Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust through the Atamis e-Tendering Portal.\r\n\r\nShould Tenderers have any queries, or having problems using the portal, they should contact Helpdesk at:\r\n\r\nPhone: 0800 9956035\r\n\r\nE-mail: support-health@atamis.co.uk\r\n\r\nThe DPS is being tendered by Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust (the Trust) to provide additional NEPT services to those already provided by the CCG. It is intended to use the DPS to provide additional patient transport vehicle and staff capacity including, but not limited to the following:\r\n\r\n- during periods of winter /summer pressures,\r\n- discharges from acute hospital settings\r\n- for patients who have a regular transport requirement between care providers.\r\n1.7 The DPS will run for 10 years and the service is primarily to provide fixed term contracts rather than one off ad hoc journeys and each will be specified within any call off contracts available through the DPS.\r\n1.8 For each call-off contract under the DPS, the Authority will apply the award criteria listed in the invitation to confirm interest. The Authority intends to formulate the award criteria more precisely in each ITT.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nTo express interest and participate in the tender, please register and apply via Atamis e-sourcing portal https://health-family.force.com/s/Welcome.\r\n\r\nShould Tenderers have any queries, or having problems using the portal, they should contact Helpdesk at:\r\n\r\nPhone: 0800 9956035\r\n\r\nE-mail: support-health@atamis.co.uk",

    "description": "A number of NHS organisations are currently migrating, or are expected to migrate from a legacy Patient Administration System (PAS) to modern Electronic Patient Record (EPR) systems. \r\n\r\nMany legacy PAS are not Referral to Treatment (RTT) compliant and, therefore, RTT Pathways and associated Events for migration have to be manually manufactured from existing referrals and outcomes.\r\n\r\nThere may also be significant data quality issues with legacy data that will impact on the management and integrity of that data prior to implementation of a new EPR system.\r\n\r\nNHS organisations may lack in-house expertise and/or capacity to undertake the necessary data cleansing exercises and may require expert assistance in undertaking a data validation exercise prior to the Client's planned migration of its legacy PAS to a modern EPR system.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this framework is to provide NHS Organisations (\"the Clients\") with expert assistance in undertaking data validation exercises prior to and following a Client's planned migration of its PAS to a modern EPR system. This includes the validation of incomplete pathways, incomplete waiting lists and duplicated pathways as well as understanding the data quality issues that could facilitate the RTT migration to the EPR system and the Client's Covid-19 restoration and recovery work. This will enable the NHS Organisations to:\r\n\r\n- provide assurance to the Board, CCGs and patients of the accuracy of the patient data held, and particularly how this is managed in relation to supporting RTT and other associated patient access standards,\r\n\r\n- improve the quality of patient data held within the EPR and support the optimal use of the EPR from implementation.\r\n\r\nThe Supplier will ensure that effective knowledge transfer takes place and will help the Client to develop an in-house central validation and booking team to achieve business as usual booking and reporting post the EPR implementation.",

This initiative aims to streamline the prescribing process, reduce medication errors, and improve overall efficiency in our healthcare delivery.\r\nMedicines optimisation is recognised to have a major influence on delivering better health outcomes for individual patients and for improving health at a population level as a process for reducing inappropriate prescribing and ensuring patient safety across care pathways\r\nIn preparation for the implementation of e-prescribe, the Trust is committed to modernising their legacy equipment and looking to purchase new Drug Trolleys to service the Southmead Site in full. This update is essential to ensure that Clinicians are familiar with the new hardware and fully prepared for the upcoming digital change. By upgrading our equipment now, we aim to provide a seamless transition and enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of our healthcare delivery.\r\nAs part of our commitment to ensuring the highest standards of patient care and operational efficiency, the Trust conducted a thorough evaluation and review of suitable drug trolleys and identified optimal models from those tested.\r\nTo ensure that the selected product is fit for purpose, it was decided that it was appropriate to test in situ to ensure that our chosen trolley was suitable for our specific needs. \r\nâ\r\nThe assessment included: \r\nâ¢\tClinician Involvement: A diverse group of clinicians from various departments participated in the trial to provide comprehensive feedback on usability.\r\n\r\nâ¢\tReal-World Testing: The trolleys were used in actual ward environments to assess their functionality, ease of use, and suitability for daily operations.

    "description": "Following a further competition under the NHS Shared Business Services Patient Discharge Services & Mental Health Step Down Care Framework - Reference: 10230, Lot 1 - Discharge to Assess Services, this notice is to inform the market of the award of a 3 year (plus an optional extension period of up to a further 12 months) contract to British Red Cross, for provision of an Assisted Discharge Service for NHS Sussex Integrated Care Board (ICB).\r\n\r\nThe contract value is Â£1,993,240.00 over the potential four year term.\r\n\r\nTimely hospital discharge, that allows people who are well enough to return to their place of residence or a community setting, is a key part of improving patient care. Discharge can be delayed for many reasons, including personal situation, the suitability of the person's place of residence or a need for greater social care support. Speeding up hospital discharge helps improve the experience of those people waiting to return to their place of residence and means hospitals can care for those who do need acute care more quickly. \r\n\r\nThis requirement is for provision of an integrated Assisted Discharge Service offer from Royal Sussex County Hospital (RSCH) across Sussex. It will align with the Discharge Transformation Programme (DTP) to deliver improved discharge processes across the whole system. The model will provide greater resilience in the community to people returning home on Pathway 0 to reduce the likelihood of readmission. It will also support admission avoidance at the front door, to prevent socially driven admissions. The service will provide support to vulnerable adults (18 years and over) who are being discharged from hospital and who lack support to return home safely. The service will transport the patient, carry out a risk assessment at the home and ensure they have everything they need to stay at home and reduce the likelihood of socially driven readmission. The service will also provide up to four weeks of ongoing support to improve resilience by supporting the person to reintegrate into their community.\r\n\r\nThe service will take patients discharged from the wards and emergency department at the Royal Sussex County Hospital (RSCH) who are resident in East Sussex, West Sussex or Brighton and Hove.",

The total estimated value stated includes the option period.\r\n\r\nAs part of the on-going contract management process, during the period of the Framework Agreement, ESPO shall monitor the financial stability of the awarded Suppliers during the period of the Framework Agreement by reference to credit rating agency reports. ESPO shall obtain a credit score for the Supplier on or before the Framework start date as a base score and where a significant change in the credit score is identified over the life of the Framework Agreement, ESPO reserves the right to investigate the reasons for this significant change. Depending on the severity of the changes, it will be at the sole discretion of ESPO to suspend or even permanently remove the Supplier from the Framework Agreement.\r\n\r\nTo tender:\r\n(a) Go to https://www.eastmidstenders.org/; (b) Register (if not already registered on ProContract); (c) Search for tender opportunity '203_25' (via \"View Opportunities\" from the 'EastMidsTenders' Portal); (d) Express an interest (if not already completed via the previously Published PIN); (e) Download the tender documents (from the ProContract Activity summary screen, once an Expression of interest has been completed).\r\n\r\nAdditional information: As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal\r\n\r\nESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.\r\n\r\nAny Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders' information only.\r\n\r\nAn eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.",

    "description": "ESPO is seeking to establish a framework with experienced consultants who can support ESPO customers with running a procurement exercise to put in place a catering and/or cleaning services contract via ESPO's Catering Services or Total Cleaning Service Solutions frameworks.\r\n\r\nLot 1 - Procurement and Contract Management Support for Catering Services\r\nLot 2 - Procurement and Contract Management Support for Cleaning Services\r\n\r\nThe contract has the option to extend for up to a further 24 months. The total estimated value stated includes the option period.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal.\r\n\r\nESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.\r\n\r\nAny Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders information only.\r\n\r\nAn eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.",

    "description": "The Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust wishes to establish a Framework Agreement under the Health Care Services (Provider Selection Regime) Regulations 2023 (and as amended) (the PSR) for use by all Relevant Authorities (and any future successors to these organisations).\r\n\r\n\"Relevant authority\" is defined in section 12ZB(7) of the National Health Service Act 2006. It means a combined authority, an integrated care board, a local authority in England, NHS England, an NHS foundation trust or an NHS trust established under section 25 of that Act. \r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, any successor bodies of any of the above entities shall be entitled to place Orders and shall be deemed Relevant Authorities for the purposes of this Framework Agreement.\r\n\r\nThe demand on radiology and pathology services is increasing. Teleradiology and telepathology services offer trusts an alternative to manage workload and support with the reduction of backlogs. \r\n\r\nTeleradiology is the transmission of patients' radiological images between different locations for the production of a primary report, expert second opinion or clinical review. Telepathology is the electronic transmission of pathological images, usually derived from microscopes, from one location to another, for the purpose of interpretation and diagnosis. The different locations can be within the same organisation or in different organisations, within the same country or across international boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, through its Commercial Procurement Services, wishes to award a national framework agreement with two Lots: \r\n\r\nLot 1 - Teleradiology and Telemedicine Services \r\nLot 2 - Telepathology Services\r\n\r\nThe term of the framework agreement will be 4 years.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: This is a Provider Selection Regime (PSR) Contract Notice. The awarding of this contract is subject to the Health Care Services (Provider Selection Regime)Regulations 2023. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 do not apply to this award.\r\n\r\nSupplier instructions how to express interest and bid:\r\n\r\n1) Browse to the esourcing portal https://www.nhssourcing.co.uk and click on view current opportunities;\r\n\r\n2) Register your organisation on the eSourcing portal (this is only required once);\r\n\r\n3) Accept the portal terms and conditions and click 'continue', enter your organisation and user details; note the username you chose and click 'Save' when complete; you will shortly receive an e-mail with your unique password (please keep this secure);\r\n\r\n4) Login to the portal with the username/password;\r\n\r\n5) Click the 'PQQs/ITTs Open To All Suppliers' link.

    "description": "Following our Market Engagement Event on Wednesday 23rd July 2025, Health Innovation North East and North Cumbria are publishing this Prior Information Notice (PIN) to inform market operators of a potential future exercise to procure services supporting the digitisation of the NENC SDE project application workflow.\r\n The North East and North Cumbria Secure Data Environment (NENC SDE) Programme seeks to procure a digital solution to streamline the referral and early application intake process for projects and data access requests. This function represents the first phase of a wider digitisation roadmap.\r\nCurrently, these early-stage workflows are highly manual; relying on emails, spreadsheets, and ad-hoc communications between stakeholders. This results in inconsistent approaches to referral capture, validation, triage, and handoff into governance channels such as the Data Access Committee (DAC) and Public Evaluation Group (PEG). The proposed solution will replace this with a consistent, auditable, and scalable digital workflow that enables transparent, efficient processing of external enquiries and early-stage research applications.\r\nThe specification will outline the requirements for a system that functions as both a user-facing portal and internal case management platform. Key capabilities should include structured form intake, document upload, progress tracking for applicants, role-based access controls, automated workflows for triage and validation, audit logs, version control, and the ability to interface with governance pathways. \r\nThis intake solution will underpin the NENC SDE's broader commitment to delivering a consistent, transparent, and user-friendly journey from enquiry through to access. The final system must align with NHS data governance and digital standards, supporting scalability across multiple stakeholder groups, including NHS organisations, researchers, and SDE programme teams.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nHI NENC would like to invite potential providers of digital solution services to apply to our Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) DN670401 as a supplier.\r\nYou can do this by following this link: procontract.due-north.com/ProjectManagement/ProjectDashboard?projectId=c1881153-e6f3-ed11-8122-005056b64545\r\nThis opportunity will be developed as a further competition under Lot 5 of our DPS.  You should therefore ensure you apply to Lot 5 to be able to bid to provide this service.\r\nYou are also welcome to apply for any other Lots on our DPS that you feel are relevant to your organisation.\r\nWe are expecting to put out the Invitation to Quote to our Lot 5 suppliers in October 2025.

    "description": "Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) looked to procure a lead provider to deliver the Working Well: Individual Placement and Support in Primary Care (WW: IPSPC) service for Greater Manchester (GM) residents. Funded via GMCA's Integrated Settlement allocation for employment support, the service will provide support for 2,000 GM residents between May 2025 and 31st March 2027. Referrals to WW: IPSPC for both out-of-work and in-work participants can be accepted up to the end of March 2026.  \r\n\r\nThe budget for the initial period of the contract (end-May 2025 to 31st March 2027) is a maximum of Â£5,000,000. The contract also includes provision for a 12-month extension up to 31st March 2028 with an additional maximum value of Â£2,400,000. This would bring the potential total lifetime value of the contract to a maximum of Â£7,400,000. \r\n\r\nThe WW: IPSPC service will sit within the Working Well suite of programmes and delivery is expected to take place in co-locations within a range of primary and community NHS health services. Participants will come from two distinct cohorts:\r\nâ¢\tOut-of-work participants with a health condition, disability, or who are experiencing disadvantage and require assistance and support to move into competitive employment.\r\nâ¢\tIn-work participants who are off sick or struggling in the workplace due to their disability, health condition, or disadvantage and require assistance and support to return to or retain employment.\r\n\r\nWW: IPSPC builds on the successful Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model, derived from Supported Employment. The service will support individuals with a physical or mental health disability, or those in a specified disadvantaged group. The model moves away from a 'train and place' model that focuses on job readiness, to a 'place, train, maintain' model focused on engagement with employers to make jobs possible - that is real jobs with real pay. Evidence shows consistently that this approach, with its focus on rapid job search, is more effective than a step-by-step pathway to employment for certain cohorts of people.\r\n\r\nThis opportunity was commissioned as a further competition/call off from the GMCA Education, Work and Skills Flexible Procurement System.",

    "description": "The Dorset system has not been able to restore the full end to end UEC (urgent and emergency care) pathway to pre-COVID performance. There has been significant emphasis on improving the UEC pathway, however the rate of improvement is not sufficient to deliver the changes necessary within the financial constraints of all partners. \r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, partners want to work together as an integrated care system to support more people to live independently at home and experience the high-quality environment and facilities that Dorset has to offer. \r\n\r\nA key element of this is working together to ensure that available hospital capacity is used effectively. We need to improve the flow across our hospital system to provide better and more timely outcomes for people, releasing more capacity for elective care and ensuring that sufficient capacity is available to meet urgent care requirements. At the same time, we need to ensure that limited social care resource is used effectively and the assets and strengths of individuals, families and their communities are fully utilised.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these outcomes, partners committed to a system wide, end to end transformation programme, initially focusing on the urgent and emergency care pathway and that this programme be supported by a 'strategic improvement partner'.\r\n\r\nFollowing a further competition utilising Crown Commercial Service (CCS) Management Consultancy Framework Three (MCF3 Framework) to let a contract to provide transformation support for the diagnostic phase of the Dorset UEC Transformation Programme, Newton were identified as the preferred 'strategic improvement partner' for the Dorset UEC Programme.\r\n\r\nThe diagnostic exercise has now been completed and the programme has progressed to the design and implementation phase.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nFollowing the diagnostic exercise a delivery plan for the design and implementation phase was agreed incorporating a contingency payment arrangement and a direct award arrangement to Newton utilising the Crown Commercial Service (CCS) Management Consultancy Framework Three (MCF3 Framework).  Formal agreement to enter into a partnership agreement and a contract with Newton was sought and obtained from system partners including NHS Dorset, Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council, University Hospitals Dorset (UHD), Dorset County Hospital (DCH) and Dorset Healthcare.  A business case was also presented and approved by the NHSE SW Regional Team.",

    "description": "NHS Mid and South Essex Integrated Care Board (hereafter referred to as \"the Authority\") invites suitably qualified providers to attend a virtual Market Engagement event for the provision Integrated &apos;Healthy Minds&apos; (Mental Health Services) on Monday 12th May 2025 at 13:00hrs - 14:00hrs. The session will be recorded and the materials presented by the Commissioners will be shared with interested parties following the event.\r\n\r\nThere are currently multiple pathways into different 'Wellbeing' mental health services due to historic commissioning arrangements made by five separate Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). The Authority was established in July 2022, superseding the CCGs. The Authority aims to address the health inequalities across the system by implementing a new single service that will ensure an equitable service and support early diagnosis and intervention for patients.\r\n\r\nCurrently, multiple VCSE providers deliver wellbeing-related services across the ICS footprint. These include:\r\n- Wellbeing Hubs\r\n- Happy Hubs\r\n- Positive Pathways for 18-25s\r\n- Adult Positive Pathways\r\n\r\nThis fragmented model has resulted in duplicated services, variable quality and access, inconsistent outcomes, and inefficiencies in service delivery. The Commissioners are seeking to undertake a single procurement approach to deliver a whole-system model that is equitable, consistent, and outcomes-focused.\r\nThe procurement process will be structured into two distinct lots to better meet the varying needs of the population and to streamline service delivery. These are:\r\na) Lot 1 - Healthy Mind Services- currently known as 'Wellbeing Hubs', 'Happy Hubs' and 'Positive Pathways' Services. This lot will focus on delivering community-based mental wellbeing support, promoting resilience, early intervention, and social connection.\r\nb) Lot 2 - Depression Wellbeing Calls - a targeted service aimed at providing proactive support for people who have been newly diagnosed with depression by their Primary Care Practitioner and/or have been prescribed medication, referred to Talking Therapies or both.\r\nThe Market Engagement event will take place virtually via MS Teams on Monday 12th May 2025 at 13:00hrs - 14:00hrs.\r\n\r\nThe event will offer an opportunity to engage with stakeholders and for prospective service providers to learn more about the service. The procurement process and timetable will also be shared.\r\n\r\nTo register interest in attending the engagement event please go to https://attain.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.html . Click on &apos;Register here&apos; and follow the onscreen instructions. The relevant documentation will be available within the sq_126 - Healthy Minds (Mental Health Services) for MSE ICB' project.\r\n\r\nThe closing date for registering attendance is Monday 12th May 2025 by 12:00 noon.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nThe content of this notice is the same as the information published in Find a Tender Service (notice number: 2025/S 000-018616). \r\n\r\nPlease Note: Any expenditure, work or effort undertaken by you prior to any subsequent procurement is a matter solely for your own commercial judgment. The Authority reserves the right to withdraw from the process at any time or to not tender the service(s) or to tender on a different basis. In such circumstances, and in any event, the Authority and/or its advisors shall not be liable for any costs or loss of expenses whatsoever incurred by any organisation, agent or subsidiary that may have contributed to any proposals submitted to this notice.

The total estimated value stated includes the option period.\r\n\r\nESPO will monitor the financial stability of the awarded Suppliers during the period of the Framework Agreement by reference to credit ratings agency reports. ESPO shall obtain a credit score for the Supplier on or before the Framework start date as a base score and where a significant change in the credit score is identified over the life of the Framework Agreement, ESPO reserves the right to investigate the reasons for this significant change. Depending on the severity of the changes, it will be at the sole discretion of ESPO to suspend or even permanently remove the Supplier from the Framework Agreement.\r\n\r\nFind A Tender Contract Award Notice reference: 2025/S 000-013436\r\n\r\nAdditional information: As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal.\r\n\r\nESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.\r\n\r\nAny Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders information only.\r\n\r\nAn eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.",

Level Two will be a smaller number of providers for a specific standard, appointed via a Further Competition, using a higher selection criteria published with each ITT. \r\n\r\nBoth levels of listing are open across all our eligible public and third sector organisations. Level Two listed providers can be selected either by employer direct award or a further competition amongst those listed.\r\n\r\nThis Requirement document covers the February 2025 final opening of the Framework and constitutes Instructions to Suppliers including mandatory requirements.\r\n\r\nAll Providers must agree to the Framework terms and conditions published as part of the Invitation to Tender (ITT) - amendments to those Terms will not be made for specific providers.\r\n\r\nPlease note the final selection of providers to award for a specific requirement is a decision for employers and this Framework does not represent a spend commitment by any organisation.\r\n\r\nIncorrectly submitted responses will be rejected and the Trust is not obliged to offer an opportunity for suppliers to resubmit correctly. \r\n\r\nThe Framework enters an extension period from 01 April 2025 until 31 March 2027.

    "description": "Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (The Trust) has awarded an interim contract for servicing and maintenance of the medical gas pipeline system (MGPS) located at the Nottingham City Hospital (The Services) following termination of the Previous Contract.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Services is to ensure the Trust complies with Health Technical Memorandum (HTM) 02-01 as well as applicable standards and relevant legislation.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to ensure the provision of safe and reliable medical gas pipeline system (MGPS) for administering of medical gases (E.g. oxygen) to patients under the care of the Trust whilst a formal procurement exercise is undertaken for a longer term contract (See following link for details: https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/007179-2025 )\r\n\r\nThe Term is 12 months to 31 May 2026.\r\n\r\nAn MGPS comprises a source of supply, pipeline distribution system, terminal units (to which the\r\nuser connects and disconnects medical equipment) and a warning/alarm system. Systems include for, but are not limited to, provision of: oxygen, nitrous oxide and medical air for respiratory and surgical applications.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the MGPS operates safely and reliably, the Trust requires a contractor to provide regular planned preventative maintenance to mitigate risks of faults or failures occurring as well as reactive maintenance services, such as call outs. A minor issue, such as a leak in the pipeline for example, may have major consequences such as patient fatality as a result of oxygen deprivation.\r\n\r\nThe Contract has been procured via further competition as permitted under Lot 11 (Medical Gas Systems) of the North of England Commercial Procurement Collaborative (NOECPC) NOE.0609 Specialist Estates Engineering & Maintenance Services (Hard FM) Framework:  https://www.noecpc.nhs.uk/free-contracts/specialist-estates-engineering-maintenance-services-hard-fm-noe-0609\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nContracts Finder Notice concerning the Previous Contract: https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/63189c47-9d77-48cc-9ebe-6f9ac77d14dc",

It promotes greater patient and public involvement by actively encouraging participation from residents, particularly seldom heard and under-represented groups such as young people and those facing health inequalities, to ensure diverse voices are represented. Additionally, it strengthens the role of the public in the commissioning, delivery, and scrutiny of local services.\r\n\r\nThe service will also provide a Wakefield Independent Health Complaints Advocacy Service; a free, independent, and impartial service. The core purpose of the Independent Health Complaints Advocacy Service is to ensure that people who use local NHS services have access to the support they need to clarify and articulate their concerns, to navigate the complaints process and to pursue a resolution to the satisfaction of the people using services or the exhaustion of the process. The Service will play no role in relation to matters where a complainant determines to resort to direct legal action other than appropriate signposting.\r\n\r\nIt is expected the Contract will be for a period of 3 years with an option to extend up to a further 7 years (10 years in total), with an expected commencement date of 1st October 2025.

The total estimated value stated includes the option period.\r\n\r\nESPO shall obtain a credit score (determined by the use of a credit rating agency) for each service provider on or before the framework start date as a base score and where a significant change in the credit score is identified over the life of the framework (or the credit score goes below 30), ESPO reserves the right to investigate the reasons for this significant change. Depending on the severity of the changes, it will be at the sole discretion of ESPO to suspend or even permanently remove the awarded service provider from the framework.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal\r\n\r\nESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.\r\n\r\nAny Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders' information only.\r\n\r\nAn eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.",

The total estimated value stated includes the option period.\r\n\r\nESPO shall monitor the financial stability of the awarded Service Providers during the period of the Framework Agreement by reference to credit ratings agency reports.\r\n\r\nESPO shall obtain a credit score (determined by the use of a credit rating agency) for the Service Provider on or before the Framework start date as a base score and where a significant change in the credit score is identified over the life of the Framework, ESPO reserves the right to investigate the reasons for this significant change. Depending on the severity of the changes, it will be at the sole discretion of ESPO to suspend or even permanently remove the Service Provider from the Framework.\r\n\r\nESPO shall monitor the Service Providers' performance against the set framework key performance indicators.\r\n\r\nMI and rebate to be collected six-monthly.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal.\r\n\r\nESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.\r\n\r\nAny Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders information only.\r\n\r\nAn eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.",

The total estimated value stated includes the option period.\r\n\r\nESPO shall monitor the financial stability of the awarded Suppliers during the period of the Framework Agreement by reference to credit rating agency reports. ESPO shall obtain a credit score for the Supplier on or before the Framework start date as a base score and where a significant change in the credit score is identified over the life of the Framework Agreement, ESPO reserves the right to investigate the reasons for this significant change. Depending on the severity of the changes, it will be at the sole discretion of ESPO to suspend or even permanently remove the Supplier from the Framework Agreement.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal.\r\n\r\nESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.\r\n\r\nAny Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders information only.\r\n\r\nAn eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.",

    "description": "The purpose of this Notice is to invite market operators to attend a Market Engagement Event for a potential future exercise to procure services supporting the digitisation of the NENC SDE project application workflow.  This event will be held online via Teams on Wednesday 23rd July 2025 at 10am.\r\n\r\nThe North East and North Cumbria Secure Data Environment (NENC SDE) Programme seeks to procure a digital solution to streamline the referral and early application intake process for projects and data access requests. This function represents the first phase of a wider digitisation roadmap.\r\nCurrently, these early-stage workflows are highly manual; relying on emails, spreadsheets, and ad-hoc communications between stakeholders. This results in inconsistent approaches to referral capture, validation, triage, and handoff into governance channels such as the Data Access Committee (DAC) and Public Evaluation Group (PEG). The proposed solution will replace this with a consistent, auditable, and scalable digital workflow that enables transparent, efficient processing of external enquiries and early-stage research applications.\r\nThe specification outlines requirements for a system that functions as both a user-facing portal and internal case management platform. Key capabilities should include structured form intake, document upload, progress tracking for applicants, role-based access controls, automated workflows for triage and validation, audit logs, version control, and the ability to interface with governance pathways. \r\nThis intake solution will underpin the NENC SDE's broader commitment to delivering a consistent, transparent, and user-friendly journey from enquiry through to access. The final system must align with NHS data governance and digital standards, supporting scalability across multiple stakeholder groups, including NHS organisations, researchers, and SDE programme teams.\r\nThis market engagement invites suppliers to demonstrate their capability to deliver and support such a solution-focusing on rapid implementation, alignment to NHS workflows, and long-term flexibility as the NENC SDE matures into Business as Usual (BAU) operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nThis event will be held online via Teams on Wednesday 23rd July 2025 at 10am.\r\n\r\nPlease apply/register to attend this event by sending your contact name, Job title, company name, and contact email address to BusinessDevelopment@healthinnovationnenc.org.uk \r\n\r\nA Prior Information Notice will be published after this Market Engagement Event to allow time for interested bidders to apply, and be accepted to, the Framework of our Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS).  \r\n\r\nThis notice is for information and engaging with the supply market only. It is not a binding statement of intent or call for competition. HI NENC reserves the right not to enter a formal process and not award a contract. The information contained in this notice, including information relating to the nature and scope of the requirements, the service classification of this requirement from the list of CPV codes, is only indicative of the HI NENC's current thinking and is neither exhaustive nor binding. HI NENC reserves the right at its absolute discretion to amend it at the time of issue of any further notices or at any other time.\r\nHI NENC will not be liable for any bid cost, expenditure, work or effort incurred by a potential supplier in acting on the basis of this Market Engagement Event",

    "description": "Buckinghamshire Council (the Council) is seeking to establish a Dynamic Purchasing Vehicle (\"DPV\") for the provision of home care Services in Buckinghamshire (\"the Services\"). The Council is conducting the procurement via the \"Light Touch Regime\" as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015).\r\nSuppliers will be expected to deliver Services for people assessed as being eligible for health or social care support under the provisions of The Care Act (2014) or The National Framework for NHS Continuing Healthcare and NHS Funded Nursing Care (2022). Additionally, Suppliers will support Individuals being discharged from hospital through the Home First pathway who are awaiting an assessment of need. The Council commissions some of these home care Packages on behalf of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West (BOB) Integrated Care Board (ICB) (\"the ICB\").\r\nThe DPV will be used to commission home care Services for adults aged 18 + across all care groups in Buckinghamshire. Successful Suppliers should expect to deliver Services to Individuals with eligibility under any of the above pathways.\r\nThe DPV will be divided into Two (2) lots, representing the range of Services to be delivered.\r\nThe Lots are:\r\nLot 1: Standard home care\r\nLot 2: Complex/bespoke home care\r\nThe Council cannot guarantee demand or volumes for the Services or for any of the Lots over the lifetime of the DPV. Appointment of a Supplier to the DPV is no guarantee of business.\r\nSuppliers that wish to be appointed to the DPV are required to complete a Selection Questionnaire (\"SQ\"). All those Suppliers who satisfy the selection requirements set out in the SQ, as evaluated by the Council, will be appointed to the DPV to the Lot(s) for which they have applied.\r\nThere is no limit on the number of Suppliers that may be appointed to a Lot.\r\nFollowing the establishment of the DPV and successful Suppliers being added (Stage 1), the Council will commence Stage 2 - call offs for Packages of care. The Council will issue mini competitions for Packages, as and when the need arises. All eligible Suppliers within the relevant Lot will be invited to submit bids for such Packages (streamlined further by geographical location for Lot 1). The Council will award each Package to the Supplier in that Lot that can most closely meet the Package requirements based upon evaluation criteria set out.\r\nSuppliers who wish to participate in this process need to register with the Buckinghamshire Business Portal and will be unable to take part if not registered. Please use the link below and follow the instructions on the website:\r\nwww.supplybucksbusiness.org.uk\r\nFurther details on the operation of the DPV are set out in the Procurement Documentation.\r\nThe DPV will be for Three years (3) with the option to extend for a further period or periods of up to Two Years (2) and then an option to extend for a further period or periods of up to One Year (1).",

    "description": "NHS England Health & Justice South East (the Commissioner) seeks to re-commission Lived Experience Services within the South East Secure Adult estate and Secure Children's and Young People's (CYP) estate. The procurement is split into 6 lots:\r\n\r\nLot 1: Kent & Medway prisons - HMP Swaleside, HMP Elmley, HMP Standford Hill, HMP Maidstone, HMP/YOI Rochester, HMP/YOI East Sutton Park and HMP Cookham Wood\r\n\r\nLot 2: Surrey prisons - HMP Send, HMP/YOI Downview, HMP Coldingley, HMP/YOI High Down and HMP/YOI Bronzefield\r\n\r\nLot 3: Thames Valley prisons - HMP Grendon, HMP Springhill, HMP Huntercombe, HMP Bullingdon and HMP Aylesbury\r\n\r\nLot 4: Sussex, Hampshire & Isle of Wight (IOW) prisons - HMP Ford, HMP Lewes, HMP/YOI Winchester and HMP IOW\r\n\r\nLot 5: South East Immigration Removal Centres (IRCs) - Gatwick IRC (Brook House & Tinsley House) and Campsfield House IRC\r\n\r\nLot 6: South East CYP establishments - Lansdowne Secure Children's Home (SCH), Swanwick Lodge SCH, Oasis Restore Secure School and the South East Framework for Integrated Care Community Services.\r\n\r\nThe contribution of service users who have first-hand experience of using the health and wellbeing services within the secure settings is essential to the delivery of effective services and informing the commissioning process. The Commissioner is committed to listening and acting upon the voice of the service user in the design, delivery and ongoing performance of health and wellbeing services. \r\n\r\nThe key aims of the Service are:\r\nâ¢\tTo ensure all service users are able to effectively contribute to the continuous improvement of health and wellbeing services, as well as being supported to have an independent voice, through various forms of engagement and regular feedback to secure setting management, the healthcare providers and commissioners\r\nâ¢\tTo enable Commissioners to receive clearly the voice of their service users to  inform decision-making in relation to healthcare provision in South East secure settings\r\nâ¢\tTo help commissioners and healthcare providers ensure that patient/service user outcomes for patients in the South East secure settings are equivalent to those in the wider community. \r\nâ¢\tTo hold commissioners and healthcare providers to account around their delivery against statutory duties.  \r\n\r\nThe service will be expected to consult / engage with service users on the full range of health and wellbeing services delivered within the establishments via delivery of both on-site and remote service user engagement / participation activities.\r\n\r\nThe service must hold independence from other (e.g. healthcare) service provision in the specified secure settings in order to have the ability to act as an independent and critical friend.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: The Lived Experience Services will be expected to support Commissioners and facilitate service user involvement in procurement processes for the provision of healthcare services within the establishments (as required over the life of the contract). \r\n\r\nCurrently, there are no planned procurement processes scheduled within the South East Detained Estates. Should this position change, the Commissioners will engage in dialogue with the successful provider to understand the financial implications (if any) of the required procurement support and the relevant contract/s may be varied to include additional funding, if required. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that the contracts will commence on 1st July 2025. The Contracts will be for an initial term of 3 years (36 months), with an option to extend for a further 3 years, at the sole discretion of the Commissioner. \r\n\r\nTUPE may apply.\r\n\r\nThe maximum annual contract value for each lot is:\r\nâ¢\tLot 1 = Â£119,000 \r\nâ¢\tLot 2 = Â£85,000\r\nâ¢\tLot 3 = Â£85,000\r\nâ¢\tLot 4 = Â£68,000\r\nâ¢\tLot 5 = Â£34,000 \r\nâ¢\tLot 6 = Â£59,000\r\n\r\nBidders may only submit bids for a maximum of 3 lots. \r\n\r\nInterested providers will be able to view this opportunity via the live opportunities list on the 'Health Family' e-procurement system, Atamis. Click on 'View our Live Opportunities' from the home page, available on the following link: https://health-family.force.com/s/Welcome.\r\n\r\nOnce you have found the opportunity (via the search function, using the title or reference number), to gain full access to the bid documentation (including questionnaires), you will need to click on 'Register interest' - this will take you to the log-in page. \r\n\r\nIf you are not already registered on the system, you will need to do so before gaining full access to the documentation and be able to submit a bid.\r\n\r\nThis procurement is being carried out by NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of the Commissioner.\r\n\r\nThe services are deemed to be subject to the full regime of current procurement legislation and as such this tender will be conducted in accordance with, and governed by, the Public Contracts Regulations 2015.  This contract will therefore be awarded in accordance with the provisions applicable in Section 5 (sub-section 7) of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015.\r\n\r\nThe contracting authority intends to observe the award decision notices provisions and 10 day standstill period described in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015.",

The total estimated value stated includes the option period.\r\n\r\nAll service providers must be accredited for appropriate contestable work categories under the National Electricity Registration Scheme (NERS) presently operated by Lloyds Register during the life of the framework.\r\n\r\nESPO shall obtain a credit score (determined by the use of a credit rating agency) for the service provider on or before the Framework start date as a base score and where a significant change in the credit score is identified over the life of the Framework (or the credit score goes below 30), ESPO reserves the right to investigate the reasons for this significant change. Depending on the severity of the changes, it will be at the sole discretion of ESPO to suspend or even permanently remove the service provider from the Framework.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal.\r\n\r\nESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.\r\n\r\nAny Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders information only.\r\n\r\nAn eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.",

This includes the validation of incomplete pathways, incomplete waiting lists and duplicated pathways as well as understanding the data quality issues that could facilitate the RTT migration to the EPR system and the Client's Covid-19 restoration and recovery work. This will enable the NHS Organisations to:\r\n\r\n- provide assurance to the Board, CCGs and patients of the accuracy of the patient data held, and particularly how this is managed in relation to supporting RTT and other associated patient access standards,\r\n\r\n- improve the quality of patient data held within the EPR and support the optimal use of the EPR from implementation.\r\n\r\nThe Supplier will ensure that effective knowledge transfer takes place and will help the Client to develop an in-house central validation and booking team to achieve business as usual booking and reporting post the EPR implementation.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nSupplier instructions how to express interest and bid:\r\n\r\n1) Browse to the esourcing portal https://www.nhssourcing.co.uk and click on view current opportunities;\r\n2) Register your organisation on the eSourcing portal (this is only required once);\r\n3) Accept the portal terms and conditions and click &apos;continue&apos;, enter your organisation and user details; note the username you chose and click &apos;Save&apos; when complete; you will shortly receive an e-mail with your unique password (please keep this secure);\r\n4) Login to the portal with the username/password;\r\n5) Click the &apos;PQQs/ITTs Open To All Suppliers&apos; link.

    "description": "The Department for Education (DfE) is considering launching a regional Industry Placement Coordinators (IPCO) project to support T Levels within NHS Integrated Care Systems (ICS). T Levels combine classroom learning with an industry placement of at least 315 hours. Industry placements offer students work experience to enhance their career prospects.\r\n\r\nThe DfE funded a pilot in 2023-25, embedding IPCOs within seven ICSs, to support the NHS to host more industry placements, addressing challenges such as limited resources and lack of awareness.\r\n\r\nVision: Building on the pilots success, the DfE wishes to explore a further project, expanding the scope of the role to cover a whole region. Each IPCO would be based within an ICS with a wider geographical remit, to broaden their impact.\r\n\r\nDesired outcomes include:\r\n-\tHigh-quality industry placement experience and a pathway to employment within the NHS\r\n-\tEnhanced employer engagement \r\n-\tCloser relationships between employers and providers\r\n-\tStandardised, efficient processes\r\n-\tSustainability.\r\n\r\nThe aims of this early market engagement event are to explore:  \r\n-\tinterest in hosting an IPCO.\r\n-\thow regional coverage could be achieved, including: how IPCOs might manage the additional workload; how this would change the role (balancing strategic and operational work); and the implications for governance.  \r\n-\thow best to distribute IPCOs, given that some NHS regions have more ICSs than others. \r\n-\thow quickly the project could start, with the goal of having IPCOs in post by 01.10.2025  \r\n-\trisks and mitigations.\r\n-\tsustainability of the project's impact beyond the funding period, including alternative ways IPCOs could be funded after DfE funding ceases.\r\n\r\n\r\nDfE will be hosting an open, virtual market engagement event on 7th February 2025 from 10:00-11:00 via Microsoft Teams. (Teams event meeting link below):\r\n\r\nhttps://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/e1d6fbaf-5883-4a18-852f-75aaf8eabdeb@fad277c9-c60a-4da1-b5f3-b3b8b34a82f9\r\n\r\nRegistered attendees will join the webinar with their cameras and mics off. They can participate via chat, reactions and Q&A and a Supplier Feedback Questionnaire will be distributed after the event to gather feedback on the propositions.\r\n\r\nPlease note this is not a call for competition and does not commit us to procuring or procuring services in specific ways, and any future opportunities are subject to budget decisions and availability.",

    "title": "Mandatory Dental Services (MDS) in Portsmouth and Havant to NHS Hampshire and Isle of Wight Integrated Care Board (ICB)",
    "description": "NHS Hampshire and Isle of Wight (HIOW) Integrated Care Board (ICB) sought providers who have the capability and capacity to deliver Mandatory Dental Services (MDS) in Portsmouth and Havant. \r\n\r\nThe procurement was divided into Lots:\r\nMDS 5C3-1: Havant - Waterlooville (21,000 UDAs)\r\nMDS 5C3-2: Havant (30,000 UDAs)\r\nMDS 5C3-3: North Portsmouth (27,000 UDAs)\r\nMDS 5C3-4: South Portsmouth (27,000 UDAs)\r\nMDS 5C3-5: Portsmouth (27,000 UDAs)\r\n\r\nInterested parties could bid for a maximum of two Lots.\r\n\r\nThe aims for MDS provision are to:\r\nâ¢contribute to improving oral and general health; \r\nâ¢reduce inequalities in health and access to dental care by providing extra support to groups of vulnerable adults and children. This includes, but is not limited to, children under 5 years old, residents of care homes, other vulnerable groups and patients weighing up to 227kg (35 stones and 10.45 lbs);\r\nâ¢provide access to NHS dental services to ensure equity and consistency of provision;\r\nâ¢provide bookable appointments outside of core hours;\r\nâ¢deliver appropriate, efficient and cost-effective services within the service;\r\nâ¢provision framework of the NHS (General Dental Services/Personal Dental Services) Regulations 2005 and any subsequent revisions;\r\nâ¢provide high quality dental services; \r\nâ¢provide access within contracted hours to un-associated patients identified as having an urgent dental need via NHS 111, NHS Dental Helpline, out of hours services and self-referral;\r\nâ¢refer patients to other NHS services as appropriate in line with the relevant local protocols and guidance;\r\nâ¢establish a positive working relationship between the Commissioner and Provider to facilitate and maximise high quality service delivery;\r\nâ¢prioritise Looked after Children (LAC);\r\nâ¢develop services in line with the evolving strategic approach to primary care dental provision and align with the priorities of the NHS Long Term Plan - www.longtermplan.nhs.uk;\r\nâ¢promote overall health in line with Making Every Contact Count;\r\nâ¢keep availability of appointments up to date on nhs.uk;\r\nâ¢comply with recall intervals, in line with NICE Guidelines (CG19).\r\n\r\nThe contracts will be for a term of up to circa 117 months. Services were due to commence from between 21st July 2025 and 19th January 2026. The actual date of commencement of the services will be subject to agreement with the commissioner, further to changes to the indicative tender timetable published. Contract commencement will vary between lots, depending upon the mobilisation period required by Bidders to commence service following award. \r\n\r\nThe maximum total budget available for each Lot was as follows:\r\nMDS 5C3-1 Â£6,812,914 \r\nMDS 5C3-2 Â£9,732,735\r\nMDS 5C3-3 Â£9,188,795\r\nMDS 5C3-4 Â£9,188,795\r\nMDS 5C3-5 Â£9,188,795\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner will be contracting for the services using the Standard clauses for a Personal Dental Services agreement.\r\n\r\nThis procurement has been carried out by NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW) on behalf of the Commissioners.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: The decision to award these contracts in line with the Competitive Process was based on evaluation against the basic selection criteria (in the form of a Selection Questionnaire), which was assessed on a pass/fail basis, and the PSR 5 key criteria, which were assessed using a 0-4 scale, pass/fail, pass with clarification and a financial risk scoring methodology, with the below weightings. \r\n\r\nSeveral tender questions were asked under each of the key criteria.\r\n\r\nQuality & Innovation - 35%\r\n\r\nValue - 10%\r\n\r\nIntegration, Collaboration and Service Sustainability - 17%\r\n\r\nImproving access, reducing health inequalities, and facilitating choice - 28%\r\n\r\nSocial Value - 10%\r\n\r\nThe providers selected for award have been chosen as they passed the basic selection criteria and were the highest scoring bidder overall, against the key criteria. Recommendations for award of contract made by the Pharmacy, Optometry and Dentistry (POD) Commissioning Lead for NHS Hampshire and Isle of Wight were approved by the NHS Hampshire and Isle of Wight ICB Executive Committee on 3rd July 2025. \r\n\r\nAfter conducting a thorough Competitive Process, taking into account the key criteria and applying the basic selection criteria, NHS Hampshire and Isle of Wight Integrated Care Board (ICB) is content that the providers' bids sufficiently met the key criteria and thus can proceed to contract award under the Health Care Services (Provider Selection Regime) Regulations 2023.\r\n\r\nFive declarations of potential conflict of interest were made via the conflict of interest process for this procurement and recorded accordingly. The non-conflicted members of the procurement have assessed the nature and risk of each declared conflict and decided which steps to take to avoid or mitigate them. Four declarations were deemed as not being actual conflicts of interest but were still managed accordingly with appropriate mitigations. The fifth declarant was excluded from further involvement in the procurement (including any decision making).\r\n\r\nContract award for Lots 2 - 5 took place on 13th August 2025, following conclusion of the standstill period. \r\n\r\nNo bids were received for Lot 1 (MDS 5C3-1: Havant - Waterlooville) and a contract has not been awarded for this area. \r\n\r\nThis is a Provider Selection Regime (PSR) confirmation of contract award notice. This contract has been awarded under the Health Care Services (Provider Selection Regime) Regulations 2023. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 and The Procurement Act 2023 do not apply to this award. This contract has now been formally awarded using the competitive process.",

    "description": "NHS Mid and South Essex Integrated Care Board (herein referred to as the &apos;Authority&apos;) seeks suitably qualified Providers for the establishment of this Framework Agreement for the provision of Voluntary Sector and Specialist SME Contracts in Mid and South Essex (previously referred to as the &apos;Pseudo Dynamic Purchasing System PDPS&apos;).\r\n\r\nThe overarching contract period of this Framework Agreement is from the 01/04/2024 - 31/03/2028 (a total of 4-years), with this Tranche 2 (the re-opening of the framework) period from the 18/06/2025 - 17/06/2026. The Framework will re-open on annual basis, as outlined in the tender documentation.\r\n\r\nThe key objectives of this Framework Agreement (FA) are to:\r\n\r\n- Establish a compliant contracting mechanism to allow the Authority to quickly source appropriate, suitable, capable providers to deliver place-based services.\r\n\r\n-To establish an Approved Provider List of providers who have met and continue to meet the Authority&apos;s minimum selection criteria over the term of the FA.\r\n\r\n-To establish a transparent Call-Off and Award Procedure that can be adapted to the individual requirements of each Call-Off contract whereby the Authority can effectively narrow the pool of eligible providers from the Approved Provider List to those most appropriate and capable to be Invited to Tender based on pre-published Categories.\r\n\r\nThe scope of services is a range of purpose led, place-based, supplementary community services that are uniquely suited to the Voluntary sector and small-to-medium-enterprises (SMEs). The framework aims to enable NHS MSE ICB to develop a process that will support the community and voluntary organisations of any size to have a governance process in place to support with future commissioning and best utilise funding as it is available. The framework aims to enable Commissioners to best distribute funding and commission services at pace, particularly during in seasonal pressures, and to cover a wide range of support services within the MSE geographical footprint. Services in this FA include Locality Specific Community Services, Voluntary Sector Specialised Services, Supplementary Community Services (Adults and Children&apos;s Services), and Supplementary Mental Health Services across the Mid and South Essex geography.\r\n\r\nThis FA has no activity guarantee, with a minimum contract value of Â£0.00 per annum. This notice has reflected a minimum value of Â£1.00 due to an error on this form which prevents the true figure of Â£0.00 per annum being illustrated in Section II.1.7) of this form. The minimum contract value of Â£0.00 pa and maximum indicative aggregate contract value Â£500million. This indicative value was calculated by using the Authority&apos;s actual annual spend across a wide range of voluntary, small and medium-sized enterprises, specialist and locality specific purpose led services across the entire geography of Mid and South Essex.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nThe Authority aims to procure such services via this FA (once it is established). Any services that do not align with the aims and objectives of this PDPS will be procured outside of this FA, in strict accordance with the Regulations.\r\n\r\nUnder this FA the Authority may look to award a Call-Off Contract of between a minimum of 3 and maximum 24 months to a provider who has been pre-approved and gained entry onto the Approved Provider List. The headline mechanisms for undertaking a Call Off Procedure under this FA are set out later in the procurement pack and will be detailed within each Call-Off Invitation to Tender (ITT).\r\n\r\nIn order to be accepted onto the FA, all Bidders responding to the Stage 1: Request to Participate will complete the mandatory Selection Questionnaire, Qualification and Technical envelopes within the e-procurement portal. The Authority aims to open the FA each year to allow for new providers to Request to Participate, complete the mandatory questionnaires and onboard onto the FA.\r\n\r\nAll potential Bidders who wish to join the FA must provide information about their proposed ability to provide the Service that is the subject of this FA, in relation to the following 'Categories' of information. The Authority will use a Filtering Process (described in Document 7) based on the information that Providers have submitted and evaluation of their SQ response, as well as any updates to such information from time to time, to identify all potential suitable PDPS Providers for the Call-Off Contract in question.\r\n\r\nThe Contracting Authority intends to reopen this FA on the following dates April 26, April 27. All relevant details pertaining to this FA are expressed within the procurement documentation that is available at https://attain.bravosolution.co.uk/. Potential Bidders can apply to be added to the FA until such time it is terminated. It should be noted that the dates are expected dates at the time of issuing this FA and may be subject to change. All details will be contained within the tender documentation and will be issued upon each new round.\r\n\r\nPlease Note: Any expenditure, work or effort undertaken by you in relation to any procurement activity is a matter solely for your own commercial judgment.\r\n\r\nTo register interest please go to https://attain.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.html . Click on &apos;Register here&apos; and follow the onscreen instructions. The relevant documentation will be available within the &apos;itt_166- VCSO & Specialist SME Contracts for NHS MSE ICB (PDPS Framework Tranche 2)&apos;&apos; project. The deadline for receipt of compliant bid submissions is 14th May 2025 at 17:30hrs. \r\n\r\nThis is a Provider Selection Regime (PSR) Contract Notice.

    "description": "This is the annual opening of the CPD/Workforce Education (non Apprenticeships) framework. DO NOT respond to list Apprenticeships - there is a seperate framework open in October 2024. \r\n\r\nPlease read the Requirements document attached carefully - this Framework covers the provision and delivery of workforce education, across all disciplines and professions, ranging from short courses to entire degree programmes.\r\n\r\nThe Framework is open across all our eligible public and third sector organisations. Employers may select providers by either Direct Award from the Course Listing, or by Further Competition managed via Salisbury.\r\n\r\nIn June 2023, the Cabinet Office introduced a new national Supplier Questionnaire (SQ) document across government. For the purposes of public procurement, NHS organisations are classed as central government bodies. Suppliers applying to this framework (C1546.390) for the first time must complete the SQ document or, if they have already completed the new (March 23) SQ for other authorities or electronically, may submit a copy of that with their Framework response. Organisations listed on the Framework from the 2022 opening need not complete the SQ document.\r\n\r\nWithin the SQ, reference is made to suppliers with Â£5m or more spend across government (e.g. Carbon Reduction and Social Value sections). When assessing if you need to reply to those questions, this is your total spend across that sector, including all NHS organisations aggregated. You may not break spend down into individual organisations in order to avoid answering the relevant sections.\r\n\r\nAll Providers must agree to the Framework terms and conditions published - amendments to those Terms will not be made for specific providers.\r\n\r\nPlease note the final selection of providers to award is a decision for employers and this Framework does not represent a spend commitment by any organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Requirement is for the July 2024 opening of the Framework, to allow for the following :\r\n\r\n1 - Existing providers to update their course listing (using the Excel document issued only)\r\n\r\n2 - New providers to apply to join the Framework\r\nFully completed responses MUST be submitted in accordance with the following :\r\n\r\nâ¢\tSubmitted by the close date via email to BOTH sft.commercial@nhs.net AND simon.dennis@nhs.net\r\nâ¢\tSubmissions MUST be fully completed - the Excel response document MUST be correctly completed.\r\nâ¢\tBids where the Bidder has applied filters, changed the sort order, or otherwise altered the original content or format, will be rejected.\r\nâ¢\tThe Response MUST be saved with a filename in the following convention only : C1546_390_YourSupplierName_July 2024 Response\r\n\r\nAdditional information: The following Contracting Authorities are entitled to place Orders: \r\nSalisbury NHS Foundation Trust and all bodies listed below :\r\n\r\nCentral Government Departments, Local Government and Public Corporations :\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/organisations\r\nPlease note Central Government departments may be subject to Government Digital Service approval before using the Framework Agreement.\r\nLocal Authorities (England and Wales)\r\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/791684/List_of_councils_in_England_2019.pdf\r\nNational Parks Authorities\r\nhttps://www.nationalparks.uk/about-us\r\nEducational Establishments in England and Wales, maintained by the Department for Education including Schools, Universities and Colleges listed :\r\nhttps://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/schools-by-type?step=default&table=schoolsÂ®ion=all-england&for=secondary\r\n\r\nPolice Forces listed by the College of Policing, plus Police Scotland and Police Service of Northern Ireland\r\nhttps://www.college.police.uk/About/Copyright_Licensing/Pages/Home-Office-police-forces.aspx\r\n\r\n Police Forces and Special Police Forces in the United Kingdom, and/or Police and Crime Commissioners (as defined by the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011) and/or the Police Authorities (as defined in the Police Act 1964, Police Act 1996, Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, Police and Justice Act 2006, Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2006), and other relevant legislation for the constituent parts of the United Kingdom, for their respective rights and interests\r\nFire and Rescue Services in the United Kingdom\r\nhttp://www.fireservice.co.uk/information/ukfrs \r\nhttp://www.nifrs.org/areas-districts/ \r\nhttp://www.firescotland.gov.uk/your-area.aspx \r\n\r\nNHS Bodies England\r\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/AcuteTrustListing.aspx \r\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/CCGListing.aspx \r\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/MentalHealthTrustListing.aspx \r\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/CareTrustListing.aspx \r\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/AreaTeamListing.aspx \r\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/SpecialHealthAuthorityListing.aspx \r\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/OtherListing.aspx \r\nHospices in the UK\r\nhttps://www.hospiceuk.org/about-hospice-care/find-a-hospice?gclid=CPLU3cD7zdECFdaRGwodNeoDyw \r\nRegistered Social Landlords (Housing Associations)\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/current-registered-providers-of-social-housing \r\nThird Sector and Charities in the United Kingdom\r\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/find-charities/ \r\nhttp://www.oscr.org.uk/search-charity-register/ \r\nhttp://www.charitycommissionni.org.uk/charity-search/ \r\nCitizens Advice in the United Kingdom\r\nhttp://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/getadvice.htm \r\nwww.cas.org.uk \r\nhttp://www.citizensadvice.co.uk/",

The total estimated value stated includes the option period.\r\n\r\nThroughout the duration of the framework, ESPO shall monitor the Supplier's financial standing against the Suppliers initial financial positioning on the commencement date of the framework. If a Suppliers financial standing falls below the position recorded on the commencement date, ESPO will raise this with Suppliers and discuss the circumstances round this.\r\n\r\nMI (Management information) for the framework will be collected every 3 months by the Contract Support Officer (CSO). The CSO will also maintain checks to ensure that any relevant insurances continued to be held.\r\n\r\nSocial Value will be assessed and monitored by the framework manager; Suppliers will be expected to demonstrate social value initiatives throughout the lifetime of the framework.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament.

ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders information only.\r\n\r\nAn eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.",

The West of England Target Operating Model for imaging across the Network is to transform and develop imaging services to support growth in activity and complexity of clinical care pathways resulting in improved patient outcomes. Pivotal to the delivery of this vision is securing the digital infrastructure to share images and associated information between providers and consumers of imaging services. This sharing of images must be safe, timely, resilient and efficient.\r\n\r\nThis is a procurement for a single supplier framework which will be awarded to one supplier only to allow all trusts in the West of England Imaging Network to call off from for the following 4 lots.\r\n1 PACS\r\n2 RIS\r\n3 A sharing solution\r\n4 Associated Storage\r\n\r\nAny bidder will need to bid for all 4 lots to be considered. The framework will be open for the maximum period of 4 years for Trusts to call off from with contract lengths for an anticipated 10 years as a maximum in a 5+3+2 contract, but may be for varying lengths in line with ambitions to have a co terminus end date for ease of network procurement at the end of the contracts. \r\n\r\nThe West of England Imaging Network consists of :\r\nGloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust\r\nGreat Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust\r\nNorth Bristol NHS Trust\r\nRoyal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust\r\nSalisbury NHS Foundation Trust\r\nSomerset NHS Foundation Trust\r\nUniversity Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust\r\n\r\nThe aim of the framework is to allow Network Trusts to procure a single instance of PACS and RIS as and when it becomes viable in line with their current incumbent contracts. In addition, for the Trusts who are unable to join for a longer period of time due to their current contracts, this framework shall allow those Trusts to procure the sharing solution until such a time as they are able to join the single instance of PACS and RIS.\r\nAs the Network host, Somerset NHS Foundation Trust will be the host of the framework, and the procurement will be run through Bristol and Weston Purchasing Consortium and as such will use their e-procurement system SAP Ariba, bidders will need register to ensure access to the tender.\r\n\r\nDetails, timelines and values are subject to change.",

    "description": "Public Sector organisations need to maximise the utility of their non-core estate.  Retail outlets in areas open to the public can contribute to income but operation of these facilities is not a core competence of Public Sector organisations.  Leasing the space to a commercial organisation could deliver better value than the current utilisation and reduce administration costs for the Public Sector while providing an enhanced service user experience.\r\n\r\nPublic Sector organisations also have an ongoing duty to demonstrate that they achieve best value from their contracts.  Open competition, conducted under transparent rules between suppliers that have already demonstrated competence and compliance with public sector standards, through their appointment to the proposed DPS, is an effective way to show that a Public Sector organisation has met this duty.\r\n\r\nCountess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Commercial Procurement Services (CPS) invites applications to join a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) for Commercial Leases for the purposes of providing Retail Outlets as described in the document \"DPS04 Dynamic Purchasing System Outline Specification.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposed Dynamic Purchasing System will offer a consistent and straightforward route for Public Sector organisations to conduct, and for suppliers to enter, a competition to award a lease contract to the most economically advantageous bidder from a list of qualified suppliers.  The Dynamic Purchasing System will act to reduce friction in the procurement process and ensure that all parties have a clear and consistent view of the contract heads of terms that will apply.\r\n\r\nContracts for the acquisition or rental, by whatever financial means, of land, existing buildings or other immovable property, or which concern interests in or rights over any of them are excluded from the Public Contracts Regulations.  In order to provide a consistent, straightforward and familiar process for Public Sector organisations, this Dynamic Purchasing System will voluntarily follow the set-up processes and structure of a DPS as set out in regulation 34 of the Public Contracts Regulations but is not bound by those Regulations.  \r\n\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust Commercial Procurement Services is explicitly not bound by regulation 34 or any other part of the Public Contracts Regulations for the purposes of this DPS.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: This DPS agreement has been extended. The new end date for this agreement is 23 February 2029.\r\n\r\nThe e-procurement portal that suppliers must use to apply for this DPS has changed.",

The total estimated value stated includes the option period.\r\n\r\nESPO shall monitor the financial stability of the awarded suppliers during the period of the framework agreement by reference to credit rating agency reports. ESPO shall obtain a credit score for the supplier on or before the framework start date as a base score and where a significant change in the credit score is identified over the life of the Framework Agreement, ESPO reserves the right to investigate the reasons for this significant change. Depending on the severity of the changes, it will be at the sole discretion of ESPO to suspend or even permanently remove the Supplier from the Framework Agreement.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal.\r\n\r\nESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.\r\n\r\nAny Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders information only.\r\n\r\nAn eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.",

    "description": "Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital NHS Foundation Trust is seeking a Strategic Energy Partner to engage in a single supplier framework for the decarbonisation of the estate, with St Thomas' Hospital's energy system as an initial anchor project and the opportunity for future projects more widely across the Trust.\r\n\r\nAt St Thomas' Hospital, electricity consumption is estimated to be 51 GWh per year and heat consumption is 37 GWh per year. An Energy as-a-Service model is proposed, with the Energy Service company retaining economic benefits from energy generation and having autonomy over any excess energy generated outside the agreed distribution to the Trust. \r\n\r\nThe Trust intends to award the framework agreement to a sole supplier.  The proposed term of the framework agreement is eight (8) years due to the nature of the works involved, the fact they are to be across multiple sites and sequentially and due to the fact that there will be economic and technical benefits to having the same provider deliver the decarbonisation across the entire estate.  The supplementary agreements entered into under the framework agreement are proposed to have a longer term of forty (40) years or longer, and the estimated value of Â£2 billion relates to the longer term.\r\n\r\nThe framework agreement will also be available for use by the other contracting authorities identified within the South East London region, subject to the Trust's prior approval. The call off contracts between the Trust and the supplier appointed to the framework agreement may include a variable mechanism to reflect the volume of energy services provided under the framework agreement.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nTo express interest and participate in the tender, please register and apply via Atamis e-sourcing portal https://health-family.force.com/s/Welcome.\r\n\r\nShould Tenderers have any queries, or having problems using the portal, they should contact Helpdesk at:\r\nPhone: 0800 9956035\r\nE-mail: support-health@atamis.co.uk\r\n\r\nFor more information https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/005322-2025",

Lots 1C and 1D will be awarded on a regional basis.\r\n\r\nThe framework agreement has the option to extend for up to a further 24 months. The total estimated value stated includes the option period.\r\n\r\nESPO shall monitor the financial stability of the awarded suppliers during the period of the framework agreement by reference to credit rating agency reports. ESPO shall obtain a credit score for the supplier on or before the framework start date as a base score and where a significant change in the credit score is identified over the life of the Framework Agreement, ESPO reserves the right to investigate the reasons for this significant change. Depending on the severity of the changes, it will be at the sole discretion of ESPO to suspend or even permanently remove the Supplier from the Framework Agreement.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal.\r\n\r\nESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.\r\n\r\nAny Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders information only.\r\n\r\nAn eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.",

    "description": "Torbay Council has direct awarded a contract for provision of its new Adults Services' Case\r\nManagement System (CMS), to the incumbent supplier of its Children's Services' System.                                                               This is a direct award, following the publication of a Voluntary ex ante transparency (VEAT)\r\nnotice (reference: 2025/S 000-000406 on 07th January 2025, and subsequent internal\r\napproval to directly award the contract from Torbay Council's Cabinet.\r\nThe system will be used by Torbay Council and Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation\r\nTrust.\r\nAward is made on the grounds that the works, supplies or services can only be provided by a\r\nparticular economic operator due to an absence of competition for technical reasons.\r\nThe Council undertook a further competition from Lot 3c of CCS' RM3821 Data &\r\nApplication Solutions Framework for a supplier for supply & ongoing maintenance of a\r\nchildren's social care CMS. It allowed for the contract to be modified to include future\r\nprovision of an adult social care CMS, as the 2 systems are required to be compatible with\r\none another. The adult social care CMS was required after the Children's contract was\r\nawarded. But due to unforeseen circumstances, including impact of COVID on social care\r\nresources there was a significant delay in putting a new system in place. Due to this and\r\nincreases in the cost of the contract from the previously estimate, the Council considers that\r\nit is no longer appropriate to modify the existing contract. However, a compatible system\r\nacross children's & adult's social care remains.\r\nWhilst there are alternative suppliers of CMS's, appointment of a different supplier will result\r\nin receiving a solution incompatible with the current children's CMS. The differences in how\r\nthe systems function will result in additional costs (to make each compatible with one\r\nanother), difficulties in implementing a new system and the ongoing operation / maintenance\r\nof both, which will not deliver best value.\r\nThis direct award will deliver the following benefits to Council, the system's end users & the\r\npublic purse:\r\nSeamless and more cost-effective integration with the current Children's CMS (Liquid Logic)\r\nby utilising the same solution, and cost savings and efficiencies in hosting arrangements by\r\nutilising the same supplier.\r\nEfficiencies, consistency & effectiveness in reporting capabilities by utilising the same\r\nsolution and in contract management by having the same supplier for both CMS.\r\nMore efficient migration of data as, the same system used to be operated across both\r\nchildren's & adult social care, meaning the Council's IT team have experience of migrating\r\ndata from the old system to the new.

Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal.\r\n\r\nESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.\r\n\r\nAny Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders information only.\r\n\r\nAn eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.",

    "description": "PLEASE NOTE, THIS TENDER (INCLUDING THE TENDER DOCUMENTS) IS RESTRICTED TO ONLY THOSE ORGANISATIONS THAT HOLD AN OFGEM GAS SUPPLY LICENCE.\r\n\r\nESPO are seeking to appoint a single supplier to a Framework covering the supply of mains gas and associated services. ESPO will act the intermediary to purchase gas on behalf of customers from across the public sector.\r\n\r\nESPO's current portfolio is approximately 6,000 sites.\r\n\r\nAs part of the on-going contract management process, during the period of the Framework Agreement, ESPO shall monitor the financial stability of the awarded Suppliers during the period of the Framework Agreement by reference to credit rating agency reports. ESPO shall obtain a credit score for the Supplier on or before the Framework start date as a base score and where a significant change in the credit score is identified over the life of the Framework Agreement, ESPO reserves the right to investigate the reasons for this significant change. Depending on the severity of the changes, it will be at the sole discretion of ESPO to suspend or even permanently remove the Supplier from the Framework Agreement.\r\n\r\nTo tender:\r\n(a) Go to https://www.eastmidstenders.org/; (b) Register (if not already registered on ProContract); (c) Search for tender opportunity '192_27' (via \"View Opportunities\" from the 'EastMidsTenders' Portal); (d) Express an interest (if not already completed via the previously Published PIN); (e) Please refer to the below regarding access to the tender documents (ESPO has now removed  the requirement to complete a Confidentiality Agreement).\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, economic operators MUST complete an Expression of interest ('register interest') for this tender opportunity (as detailed above, and if not already completed via the previously Published PIN), after which you will be able to access the Messages area on the eProcurement Portal (ProContract).\r\n\r\nTo request access to the Tender documents, you MUST submit a Message on the eProcurement Portal for this Opportunity / Activity, confirming your Company Name and Registration Number. Upon verification of this information (including that an OFGEM Gas Supply Licence is held), access to the Tender documents will be enabled by ESPO (the eProcurement Portal, ProContract, creates a notification for this once this is completed).\r\n\r\nFor reference, the Invitation to Tender will be made available in accordance with the above on condition that its contents (including the fact the Tenderer receives the Invitation to Tender) is kept confidential by the Tenderer and is not copied, reproduced, distributed or passed to an other person at any time, except for the purpose of enabling the Tenderer to submit a tender.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal.\r\n\r\nESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.\r\n\r\nAny Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders information only.",

Thus any system which does not meet these standards will be phased out. \r\n\r\nThis is a replacement of the existing NHS England endorsed FWA accredidated by 'NHS Framework Strategy Recommendation' programme.  \r\n\r\nThe beneficiaries of the services are NHS Patients receiving Healthcare Services, service users or Citizens within a Local or Central Government organisation within the wider Public Sector Organisations.\r\n \r\nThe framework will be divided into 13 lots, as follows:\r\n \r\nLot 1: Patient Messaging Services\r\n\r\nLot 2: Medical Messaging Application (Pager Replacement)\r\n\r\nLot 3: Kiosk Display (Digital Signage)\r\n\r\nLot 4: Patient Check-In and Queue Management System\r\n\r\nLot 5: App Development Services\r\n\r\nLot 6: Social Marketing Services\r\n\r\nLot 7: Video Conferencing System\r\n\r\nLot 8: In-patient Infotainment Management System\r\n\r\nLot 9: Medical Representative Check-In Software System\r\n\r\nLot 10: Lone Worker Safety & Kits\r\n\r\nLot 11- Streamlined Patient Pathways/flow\r\n\r\nLot 12-  Artificial Intelligence-enabled Digital Care systems\r\n\r\nLot 13: Bespoke Services",

    "description": "This is the annual opening of the CPD/Workforce Education (non Apprenticeships) framework. DO NOT respond to list Apprenticeship Programmes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to an opportunity for new suppliers, this is a mandatory update for all exiting suppliers - any existing supplier not responding will be de-listed from the Framework. \r\n\r\nPlease read the Requirements document attached carefully - this Framework covers the provision and delivery of workforce education, across all disciplines and professions, ranging from short courses to entire degree programmes.\r\n\r\nThe Framework is open across all our eligible public and third sector organisations. Employers may select providers by either Direct Award from the Course Listing, or by Further Competition managed via Salisbury.\r\n\r\nIn June 2023, the Cabinet Office introduced a new national Supplier Questionnaire (SQ) document across government. For the purposes of public procurement, NHS organisations are classed as central government bodies. Suppliers applying to this framework (C1546.390) for the first time must complete the SQ document or, if they have already completed the new (March 23) SQ for other authorities or electronically, may submit a copy of that with their Framework response. \r\n\r\nWithin the SQ, reference is made to suppliers with Â£5m or more spend across government (e.g. Carbon Reduction and Social Value sections). When assessing if you need to reply to those questions, this is your total spend across that sector, including all buyer organisations aggregated. You may not break spend down into individual organisations in order to avoid answering the relevant sections.\r\n\r\nAll Providers must agree to the Framework terms and conditions published - amendments to those Terms will not be made for specific providers.\r\n\r\nPlease note the final selection of providers to award is a decision for employers and this Framework does not represent a spend commitment by any organisation.\r\n\r\nThis Requirement is for the May 2025 opening of the Framework, to allow for the following :\r\n\r\n1 - Existing providers to update their course listing (using the Excel document issued only)\r\n\r\n2 - New providers to apply to join the Framework\r\n\r\nFully completed responses MUST be submitted in accordance with the following :\r\n\r\nâ¢\tSubmitted by the close date via email to BOTH sft.commercial@nhs.net AND simon.dennis@nhs.net\r\nâ¢\tSubmissions MUST be fully completed - the Excel response document MUST be correctly completed.\r\nâ¢\tBids where the Bidder has applied filters, changed the sort order, or otherwise altered the original content or format, will be rejected.\r\nâ¢\tThe Response MUST be saved with a filename in the following convention only : C1546_390_YourSupplierName_May25 Response\r\n\r\nAdditional information: The following Contracting Authorities are entitled to place Orders: \r\nSalisbury NHS Foundation Trust and all bodies listed below :\r\n\r\nCentral Government Departments, Local Government and Public Corporations :\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/organisations\r\nPlease note Central Government departments may be subject to Government Digital Service approval before using the Framework Agreement.\r\nLocal Authorities (England and Wales)\r\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/791684/List_of_councils_in_England_2019.pdf\r\nNational Parks Authorities\r\nhttps://www.nationalparks.uk/about-us\r\nEducational Establishments in England and Wales, maintained by the Department for Education including Schools, Universities and Colleges listed :\r\nhttps://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/schools-by-type?step=default&table=schoolsÂ®ion=all-england&for=secondary\r\n\r\nPolice Forces listed by the College of Policing, plus Police Scotland and Police Service of Northern Ireland\r\nhttps://www.college.police.uk/About/Copyright_Licensing/Pages/Home-Office-police-forces.aspx\r\n\r\n Police Forces and Special Police Forces in the United Kingdom, and/or Police and Crime Commissioners (as defined by the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011) and/or the Police Authorities (as defined in the Police Act 1964, Police Act 1996, Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, Police and Justice Act 2006, Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2006), and other relevant legislation for the constituent parts of the United Kingdom, for their respective rights and interests\r\nFire and Rescue Services in the United Kingdom\r\nhttp://www.fireservice.co.uk/information/ukfrs \r\nhttp://www.nifrs.org/areas-districts/ \r\nhttp://www.firescotland.gov.uk/your-area.aspx \r\n\r\nNHS Bodies England\r\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/AcuteTrustListing.aspx \r\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/CCGListing.aspx \r\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/MentalHealthTrustListing.aspx \r\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/CareTrustListing.aspx \r\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/AreaTeamListing.aspx \r\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/SpecialHealthAuthorityListing.aspx \r\nhttp://www.nhs.uk/ServiceDirectories/Pages/OtherListing.aspx \r\nHospices in the UK\r\nhttps://www.hospiceuk.org/about-hospice-care/find-a-hospice?gclid=CPLU3cD7zdECFdaRGwodNeoDyw \r\nRegistered Social Landlords (Housing Associations)\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/current-registered-providers-of-social-housing \r\nThird Sector and Charities in the United Kingdom\r\nhttp://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/find-charities/ \r\nhttp://www.oscr.org.uk/search-charity-register/ \r\nhttp://www.charitycommissionni.org.uk/charity-search/ \r\nCitizens Advice in the United Kingdom\r\nhttp://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/getadvice.htm \r\nwww.cas.org.uk \r\nhttp://www.citizensadvice.co.uk/",

Eight of these lots consider a specific Sub-Region in the North East, while the final two lots consider national Framework usage.  \r\n\r\nNEPO intend to award two suppliers to each lot. For Lots 1 - 7, the first supplier will be the Primary Supplier (Rank One) and the second ranked Supplier will be the Contingency Supplier (Rank Two). Orders will only be placed with the Contingency Supplier should the Primary Supplier be unable to deliver. For Lots 8 - 10, no ranking will be in place, with the highest scoring suppliers awarded. Customers will be required to conduct further competition within Lots 8, 9 and 10 in order to call off from the Framework.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity can be accessed via the NEPO eTender system (Open).

    "title": "Provision of Enhanced Residential Services for (Primarily) Working Age Adults with Disabilities and/or Mental Health Needs",
    "description": "Cumberland Council is looking to procure a Framework for Provision of Enhanced Residential Services for (Primarily) Working Age Adults with Disabilities and/or Mental Health Needs. Residential care providers (current and new) are invited to submit a bid in order to be accepted on to the new Framework to deliver high quality services. Whilst it is not mandatory for providers joining the Framework to have a residential service within Cumberland, providers must have accommodation with an appropriate CQC registration. The aim of the Service is to enable people to maximise and maintain and (where possible) regain their independence. Providers will support individuals to be healthy and happy, to build and maintain relationships, to achieve goals and aspirations, to have choice and control and to participate and thrive in their local community, both inside and outside of the care home. Provision has been included to support use of the Framework by North East and North Cumbria Integrated Care Board (NENCICB) during the term of the Framework. Further discussions are being held with NENCICB around scoping access. For further information refer to Schedule 2 Service Specification.\\r\r\n\\r\r\nThe are two Lots (1 & 2). All providers who join the Framework will join under Lot 1 and will automatically be eligible for Lot 2. Providers can only join Lot 2 by being eligible and successful to join Lot 1. \\r\r\nLot 1 - Individual Placement - Cumberland Council will commission residential services via referral and follow the Call Off processes outlined in the Award Process Schedule 2 of the Framework Agreement.\\r\r\nLot 2 - Bespoke Services - Should the Council wish to procure a bespoke service it will follow the mini competition process as outlined in the Award Process Schedule 2 of the contract. For the avoidance of doubt the Council will not be obliged to commission any services under Lot 2.\\r\r\n\\r\r\nThe framework will be 'open', which means that new providers can submit a bid to be considered via The Chest at any time over the initial two year period (and during the two extension periods if these are used). New bids will be assessed every two months after the initial round.\\r\r\n\\r\r\nFunding is from Cumberland Council and NHS Northeast and North Cumbria Integrated Care Board (NENCICB). The estimated value for the initial two year term of the Framework is Â£19.1m (excluding VAT) funded by Cumberland Council and Â£5.1m (excluding VAT) funded by NENCICB. The estimated total value for both parties combined for the initial two year term is Â£24.2m (excluding VAT).  The estimated total value of the Framework Agreement for the initial term plus the two optional extension periods (if used) of up to twelve months each is:\\r\r\nÃ¢â¬Â¢\tCumberland Council - Â£39.8m (excluding VAT)\\r\r\nÃ¢â¬Â¢\tNENCICB - Â£11.0m (excluding VAT)\\r\r\nÃ¢â¬Â¢\tCumberland Council & NECICB - Â£50.8m (excluding VAT)\\r\r\nDetails of current expenditure are indicative only.  The Council does not guarantee any spend against this Framework Agreement.\\r\r\n\\r\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional information: \r\nThe Council proposes to enter into the Framework Agreement for an initial period of TWO years with the successful Tenderers from 1st May 2025 to 30th April 2027. There are TWO optional extensions of 12 months each. These optional extensions are at the absolute discretion of the Council. If these optional extensions are used, the framework will end on 30th April 2029. The council may, at its discretion, stop accepting bids to join the framework at any time. In this case, a notice will be sent out via the Chest to inform all prospective bidders.\r\n\r\nFor further details and to access the tender documents, including the service specification, use the council's online procurement portal - The Chest - https://www.the-chest.org.uk. Registration on The Chest is free. All bids must be received electronically via The Chest by the closing date stated in the ITT. Any clarifications you have about the tender must be sent via messaging on The Chest by the closing date stated in the ITT.",

Lots 3A and 3B on a national basis.\r\n\r\nHowever, Lots 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D have not been awarded as a result of this procurement.\r\n\r\nThe framework agreement has the option to extend for up to a further 24 months. The total estimated value stated includes the option period.\r\n\r\nESPO shall monitor the financial stability of the awarded Suppliers during the period of the Framework Agreement by reference to credit ratings agency reports. ESPO shall obtain a credit score for the Supplier on or before the Framework Start Date as a base score.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal.\r\n\r\nESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.\r\n\r\nAny Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders information only.\r\n\r\nAn eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.",

The total estimated value stated includes the option period.\r\n\r\nFood Safety Accreditation - Suppliers must have, and retain throughout the framework lifetime, a relevant third-party food safety accreditation (such as BRC, STS) in relation to the manufacture and/or storage of Food products. Failure to retain such accreditation must be immediately reported to ESPO and will be at the sole discretion of ESPO to suspend or even permanently remove the Supplier from the Framework Agreement. Certificate copies will be sent to ESPO annually, on the expiry/renewal date of such accreditation.\r\n\r\nFinancial - As part of the on-going contract management process, throughout the period of the Framework Agreement, ESPO shall monitor the financial stability of the awarded Supplier by reference to credit rating agency reports. ESPO shall obtain a credit score for the Supplier on or before the Framework start date as a base score and where a significant change in the credit score is identified over the life of the Framework Agreement, ESPO reserves the right to investigate the reasons for this significant change. Depending on the severity of the changes, it will be at the sole discretion of ESPO to suspend or even permanently remove the Supplier from the Framework Agreement.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal.\r\n\r\nESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.\r\n\r\nAny Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders information only.\r\n\r\nAn eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.",

    "description": "Point of Care (PoC) suppliers deliver technical systems that operate in clinical environments to capture patient, vaccination type, and vaccine batch data for each vaccination event undertaken in that health setting.  \r\nThe beneficiaries of the vaccination data captured and flowed by these PoC systems include: NHS-Vaccine Digital Services (VDS), which uses the data to set the Preventative Health strategies, update DPS and the PDS/Spine systems, as well as wider use cases through UKHSE, DHSC and various health research programmes.\r\n\r\nThis procurement sought supplier engagement to a 12-month contract for provision of PoC systems and services for vaccination data captured in Community Pharmacy (CP) settings.  A maximum number of 5 contracts would be awarded which would allow awarded suppliers to operate in a competitive and transactional manner, with the available CP market shared between them and payments made based on the actual number of CPs using each respective supplier PoC system in a month.\r\n\r\nMarket engagement was undertaken through an open and anonymous webinar held on 27th June 2024; after which 26 parties registered their interest via the e-procurement portal, Atamis, through which the procurement was run.  \r\nThe market engagement was followed on 27th August 2024 with the release of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaires (PQQ) and PQQ instructions documents.  The PQQ asked interested parties to provide information under business operation, and, clinical and technical system capabilities parameters.  \r\n\r\nSubmission of the PQQ responses was required by 17:00 on 30th September; there were 6 responses received to the PQQ phase.\r\n\r\nPQQ responses were evaluated against numerical and weighted scoring parameters, as defined in the PQQ instructions, for business operation (40% of total), clinical capabilities (20% of total), technical capabilities (40% of total), in order to arrive at a score out of 100% for each respondent.  Parties achieving at least the minimum threshold of 70% were qualified to progress to the Invitation to Tender (ITT) phase.\r\n\r\nThe ITT documents, which consisted of Instructions, Technical capabilities, Clinical capabilities, Social Value, Contractual/Commercial and GDPR questionnaires, were published to qualifying suppliers on 16th October 2024; all responses were required for submission by 23:59 on 10th November 2024.  \r\n\r\nFive responding parties progressed through to the ITT phase and in accordance with the ITT evaluation instructions, all parties were then offered a contract.  However, one supplier decided not to progress through the contracting phase and exited the market.  \r\n\r\nTherefore, four contracts were awarded to all remaining fully qualified suppliers: EMIS(Optum), Sonar, Cegedim and Positive, to allow for their provision of vaccination data capture systems and services in Community Pharmacy settings, subject to passing clinical, operational and technical assurance standards (as published via the NHS Digital Services Catalogue).",

Providers are asked to assure Service User wellbeing through the delivery of Service User Focused Outcomes, which have been developed in line with Care Act guidance.\\r\r\n\\r\r\nAll providers who wish to be considered to join the framework should submit a bid before the stated deadline (see 2.1).  The framework will be 'open', which means that new providers can submit a bid to join at any time over the initial 4 year period (and during the four extension periods if these are used).  A notice will be uploaded to The Chest to explain the future bidding process for providers after the initial bid submission deadline (stated at 2.1) has passed.    \\r\r\n   \\r\r\nThe council discourages speculative applications from out of county providers, as these will not be evaluated unless a placement is required.\\r\r\n\\r\r\nThe Council reserves the right to close the Framework to new applications if in its opinion, there is good reason to do so.  Where this discretion is used, the Council will notify its intention and the period which the Framework will be closed.\\r\r\n\\r\r\nIn order to maintain high standards and ensure the safety of Service Users, the Council reserves the right to reject any applications from Providers who have a CQC rating below \"Good\" and/or have received negative feedback from other authorities or key stakeholders.  Applications may still be considered on a case-by-case basis at the Council's discretion. Providers may be asked to provide supplementary information through the Councils Quality Improvement Process (QIP)\\r\r\n\\r\r\nThe Framework Agreement includes requirements around delivery of Social Value and payment of the Real Living Wage to staff engaged in the delivery of Services.

    "description": "This is a national framework arrangement, via which eligible public sector organisations across the UK, can arrange for the rental of a wide spectrum of vehicle types (ranging from small cars and vans through to heavier specialist vehicles) from a choice of service providers. The framework is intended to meet the requirements of local government and public sector bodies.\r\n\r\nLot A - Cars\r\nLot B - Mini-Buses\r\nLot C - Light Commercial Vehicles\r\nLot D - Refuse Collection Vehicles\r\nLot E - Sweepers and Gully Emptiers\r\nLot F - HGV Tippers & Loaders\r\nLot G - HGV Winter Maintenance Vehicles\r\nLot W - Master Vendor Vehicle Rental\r\nLot X - Flexi Vehicle Rental\r\nLot Y - Vehicle Club Rental Schemes - Business to Business\r\nLot Z - Vehicle Club Rental Schemes - Business to Business + Public Usage\r\n\r\nLots Y and Z have however not been awarded.\r\n\r\nThe framework agreement has the option to extend for up to a further 24 months. The total estimated value stated includes the option period.\r\n\r\nESPO shall monitor the financial stability of the awarded service providers during the period of the framework by reference to credit ratings agency reports. ESPO shall obtain a credit score for the service providers on or before the framework start date as a base score and where a significant change in the credit score is identified over the life of the framework, ESPO reserves the right to investigate the reasons and, at its discretion, take appropriate action.\r\n\r\nAdditional information: As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal.\r\n\r\nESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.\r\n\r\nAny Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders information only.\r\n\r\nAn eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.",
