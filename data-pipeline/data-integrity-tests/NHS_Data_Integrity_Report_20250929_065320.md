### Identified Risks

#### Data Integrity (HIGH Risk)
**Description:** 2 critical data integrity issues identified

**Impact:** Inaccurate dashboard reporting, incorrect clinical decision support

**Mitigation:** Address all critical issues before production deployment

#### Data Completeness (HIGH Risk)
**Description:** 67 NHS trusts missing from database

**Impact:** Incomplete national NHS performance picture

**Mitigation:** Complete migration of all trust data

#### Data Accuracy (MEDIUM Risk)
**Description:** Mathematical inconsistencies in 32.9% of calculations

**Impact:** Incorrect performance metrics and trend analysis

**Mitigation:** Review and fix data transformation algorithms

#### Performance Standards (MEDIUM Risk)
**Description:** Very low A&E 4-hour standard compliance (20.9%)

**Impact:** May indicate data quality issues or system-wide performance problems

**Mitigation:** Validate A&E data collection and processing procedures

## Recommended Action Plan

**Estimated Timeline:** 4-6 weeks for full resolution

### Priority Actions

   - Success Criteria: Zero critical issues in re-testing

2. **Complete Database Migration** (1-2 weeks)
   - Migrate remaining 67 NHS trusts and missing time periods
   - Owner: Data Migration Team
   - Success Criteria: 100% trust and period coverage in database

3. **Improve Mathematical Consistency** (2 weeks)
   - Fix calculation errors and implement validation rules
   - Owner: Data Quality Team
   - Success Criteria: >95% mathematical consistency rate

4. **Implement Data Quality Monitoring** (3 weeks)
   - Set up automated data quality checks and alerting
   - Owner: Data Platform Team
   - Success Criteria: Automated quality monitoring operational

5. **Comprehensive Re-testing** (1 week)
   - Re-run complete test suite after fixes are implemented
   - Owner: QA Team
   - Success Criteria: All test phases pass with <5% warning rate

## Conclusion

High-risk issues must be resolved before production deployment

**Next Steps:**
1. Review this report with stakeholders
