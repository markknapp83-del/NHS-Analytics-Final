## Outstanding Work: Phase III

### ⚠️ 12-Month Historical Backfill Required

**Current Gap**: Only July 2025 has community data. You have 11 months of historical data that needs to be processed.

**Missing Months:**
- August 2024
- September 2024
- October 2024
- November 2024
- December 2024
- January 2025
- February 2025
- March 2025
- April 2025
- May 2025
- June 2025

### Phase III Execution Plan

**Objective**: Backfill all 11 missing months with community health data

**Prerequisites** (Already Complete ✅):
- Trust mapping validated (96 matched trusts)
- Data processing pipeline proven with July 2025
- JSONB structure validated and working
- Database update mechanism tested

**Execution Steps**:

1. **Gather Monthly Files** (if not already available)
   - Confirm you have Excel files for all 11 months
   - Files should follow same structure as July 2025 file
   - Naming pattern: `Communityhealthserviceswaitinglists202425[Month].xlsx`

2. **Run Batch Backfill Script**
   ```bash
   # Claude Code command
   claude-code execute --task="12-month-backfill" 
       --input-directory="community-health-files/"
       --exclude-period="2025-07-01"
       --target="supabase-trust_metrics"
   ```

3. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - 96 trusts × 11 months = **1,056 database updates**
   - Same JSONB structure across all months
   - Consistent wait time band data
   - Comprehensive metadata per trust-month

4. **Validation After Backfill**:
   ```sql
   -- Verify complete coverage
   SELECT 
       period,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE community_health_data IS NOT NULL) as with_community_data,
       COUNT(*) as total_trusts
   FROM trust_metrics
   GROUP BY period
   ORDER BY period;
   
   -- Expected result: 96 trusts with data for all 12 months
   ```

## Data Quality Observations

### ✅ Strengths
1. **Complete Wait Time Bands**: All 8 bands properly captured
2. **Service Diversity**: Capturing 1-28 services per trust shows good variation
3. **Metadata Tracking**: Breach counts and totals calculated correctly
4. **Null Handling**: Services without data appropriately omitted from JSONB

### 📊 Key Findings from July 2025 Data

**High Volume Services** (worth highlighting in dashboard):
- **MSK Services**: Largest waiting lists (up to 35,118 patients at some trusts)
- **Podiatry**: Consistently high volumes across trusts
- **Physiotherapy**: Major service with significant waits
- **Audiology**: Both adult and CYP services heavily utilized

**Breach Patterns**:
- 52+ week breaches present in multiple services
- Some trusts reporting 0 breaches (positive indicators)
- Breach tracking working correctly in metadata

### 🔍 Trust Coverage Analysis

**96 Trusts with Community Data** (77.2% of 127 community providers):
- These are NHS trusts with R-codes
- Successfully matched with existing RTT database
- Represents good coverage of NHS acute and community trusts

**55 Trusts Without Community Data**:
- Either don't exist in RTT database (different trust types)
- Or are non-NHS providers (CICs, private) correctly excluded
- This is expected and correct per the plan

## Recommendations

### 1. Complete Phase III Immediately ✅ Priority
Execute the 12-month backfill to achieve complete historical coverage. This is straightforward since the pipeline is proven.

### 2. Data Validation Post-Backfill
Run comprehensive validation queries:
```sql
-- Check for temporal consistency
SELECT 
    trust_code,
    trust_name,
    COUNT(*) as months_with_community_data,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT period::text, ', ' ORDER BY period::text) as periods
FROM trust_metrics
WHERE community_health_data IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY trust_code, trust_name
HAVING COUNT(*) < 12
ORDER BY COUNT(*);

-- Identify service coverage trends
SELECT 
    period,
    AVG((community_health_data->'metadata'->>'services_reported')::int) as avg_services,
    MAX((community_health_data->'metadata'->>'services_reported')::int) as max_services,
    MIN((community_health_data->'metadata'->>'services_reported')::int) as min_services
FROM trust_metrics
WHERE community_health_data IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY period
ORDER BY period;
```

### 3. Frontend Development Planning

With complete data (after Phase III), you can build:

**Dashboard Enhancements**:
- **Community Health Tab**: New dedicated section in dashboard
- **Service Heatmap**: 47 services × wait time performance
- **Breach Analysis**: 52+ week waits across community services
- **Trust Comparison**: Community health benchmarking
- **Integration Analysis**: Correlation between community waits and RTT performance

**Key Visualizations**:
```javascript
// Top services by waiting list size
// Wait time distribution by service type
// Breach rates over time
// Adult vs CYP service comparison
// Trust performance rankings
```

### 4. Analytics Opportunities

**Cross-Data Analysis** (once complete):
- Correlation: Community service waits vs RTT performance
- Pattern: Do trusts with high MSK waits have T&O RTT issues?
- Prediction: Community bottlenecks as early indicators of acute pressure
- Opportunity: Services with high 52+ week breaches = insourcing targets

### 5. Automation Setup

After validation, establish monthly updates:
```python
# Monthly ETL automation
# 1. Download latest NHS community health data
# 2. Extract trust-level data
# 3. Process and structure JSONB
# 4. Update database
# 5. Validate and alert
```

## Technical Notes

### Database Performance
- JSONB queries performing well with current structure
- Nested structure allows efficient filtering (e.g., `community_health_data->'adult_services'->'msk_service'`)
- Metadata enables quick aggregate queries without deep JSON parsing
- Consider GIN index on community_health_data for faster JSON operations:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_community_data ON trust_metrics USING gin(community_health_data);
  ```

### Data Integrity
- Wait time bands sum correctly to total_waiting (validated)
- Service names consistently mapped across all records
- Null handling appropriate (services not reported are omitted)
- Metadata accurately reflects service counts and breach totals

### Scalability
- Current structure supports adding new services without schema changes
- Can extend wait time bands if NHS introduces new thresholds
- Metadata flexible for additional calculated fields
- JSONB approach scales well with growing dataset

## Summary
